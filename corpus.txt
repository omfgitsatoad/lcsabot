 Sorry Jay, that fence is at the back of your house right?
 *fortification
 Na Tom, front
 clearly the front
 Just gotta dig the moat
 this is how they live out there
 fortified against the neighbors
 Stunning. I mean by the house it looks like the front.. it's just so abrasive haha. I admire the handy work though!
 Nice friendly neighbourhood ðŸ˜‚
 Love the sarcasm on the recycling bin too.."thanks for caring"
 Some shit cunt stole one of our bins, so we reclaimed some one else's, and out of sheer panic and general white trash chic, we whacked out the white paint and brush and turned 77 into 127
 Marvellous!!
 That's pretty good to be fair
 Sly moves
 We once did that in a flat and I think someone saw us do it because a tug of war ensued and in the end we had to buy another from the council.. was about 150bar
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Yeah I called the council and that want big bucks for a new one.
 Presumably in any given postcode there is always -1 wheelie bin and they just get slid around like one of those old puzzles with a piece missing
 If someone orders a new one, a person from the council comes and takes another away, just to keep the game going
 All the while, the unlucky residents are going "who would steal a bin!"
 Yeah you're totally right. I called em, I refused to buy a new one as mine had been taken and said I'll just liberate one from somewhere and the geezer didn't seem fussed
 Heading boats
 rog rog
   amy asks if you can bring food
 Presumably Vegan
 I have hula hoops
 I'm by the skatepark by the canal

 Asked Kier about it he hadn't heard a thing
 But yeah I think every company is acting on this shit..
 Can't get over how good ww2 in colour is
 Haha im gonna have to check this out
 It's so detailed
 By law you only need one working brake mechanism
 And it does not state where the lever has to be as long as it's a legit working brake mechanism
 Ahoyyyyd
 Yeh your right
 I still reckon Kevin would be funny with that haha
 Of course he would
 U have a brake lever on your fork it looks like the work of a maniac
 PR nightmare
 Oh well
 Jay got me a tick on the book
 I bet in 2 months people will have forgotten about this
 Cheers Jay
 Trump will have said something stupid.
 Yup!

 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Pretty much
 Wack
 Is it busy?

 I tbh put it on the fork as protest form and also not to end up using it eventually. Like going down a steep loading bay and scraping my rims :/

 Argument happening in my head
 As soon as I get a brake, get in an accident

 Reasons to go to work: It's your job

 i don't reckon

 Don't mean to be a conspiracy theorist here, but why is it that every single drink they give away for free has aspartame in it?
 #wakeupsheeple
 Haha
 Seriously though it's poison and they are getting us addicted!
 what makes you think it's poison?
 in response to your actual question though. money. it's cheaper as a sweetener than what they were previously using.
 Okay cheers Sam
 It was disapproved by the FDA for years
 Then somehow was made legal recently
 I don't know that much but from what I been told
 And breifly read up on
 But I understand that point. Probably not much worse than stevia etc
 do you have faith in snopes?
 because they seem to think it's calm
 but i'm not sure what it is you're actually claiming, so maybe it's unrelated
 also i think the fda is fairly strict?
 i'm under the impression the european one is more open minded
 i could be wrong though
 https://youtu.be/a9HThnTqOCI
 Listen to the start of that mix haha
 Tbh that's where im getting my conspiracy from.
 yeah
 that guy is a fucktard
 someone has just cycled down the towpath shouting "it's gonna be like 4 lions bro, going to paradise, ya know what i mean?"
 don't get me wrong though.... drinking carbonated beverages isn't helping in any way, but they are delicious
 It's a chemical warfare byproduct
 I'm in ironmongers hall
 And I'm Indian

 Sure will boss
 it's about a little shit of a kid from liverpool who takes a bunch of lsd and dmt with a tramp and ends up in some mad multidimensional war between good and evil
 all the good people are gangsters or punks
 all the evil people are upperclass fox hunters
 it's really trippy. the guy who wrote it is some mad stoner from glasgow

 adi lee

 Alright man sorry
 Different fat guy
 the guy i'm thinking of is an old school rider
 went away and came back a couple of years ago
 Because I locked to that same pole as him
 adrian's just a dick
 as tim said, he's been a rookie for about 20 years
 ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜‚
 he used to be a classic guy for obscene fictional docket counts for the day. always claim he had done like 90 dockets or something
 <Media omitted>
 linton conrathe

 He stares at me constantly.
 Fucking weirdo
 Fucking hell
 That man is scary

 Seamus heard me say cunt once and phoned me straight away to tell me off
 Hahahaha
 Don't mean to be a conspiracy theorist here, but why is it that every single drink they give away for free has aspartame in it?
 #wakeupsheeple
 Haha
 Seriously though it's poison and they are getting us addicted!
 what makes you think it's poison?
 in response to your actual question though. money. it's cheaper as a sweetener than what they were previously using.
 Okay cheers Sam
 It was disapproved by the FDA for years
 Then somehow was made legal recently
 I don't know that much but from what I been told
 And breifly read up on
 But I understand that point. Probably not much worse than stevia etc
 do you have faith in snopes?
 because they seem to think it's calm
 but i'm not sure what it is you're actually claiming, so maybe it's unrelated
 also i think the fda is fairly strict?
 i'm under the impression the european one is more open minded
 i could be wrong though
 https://youtu.be/a9HThnTqOCI
 Listen to the start of that mix haha
 Tbh that's where im getting my conspiracy from.
 yeah
 that guy is a fucktard
 someone has just cycled down the towpath shouting "it's gonna be like 4 lions bro, going to paradise, ya know what i mean?"
 don't get me wrong though.... drinking carbonated beverages isn't helping in any way, but they are delicious
 It's a chemical warfare byproduct
 I'm in ironmongers hall
 And I'm Indian
 >warcrime
 tobacco and weed are much more poisonous than this shit
 and i don't here you complaining about that
 #staywoke
 Hahahaha
 Let's hope there talking about rubber dingy rapids
 Fair enough

 Sams to much
 just pretty sure it was allowed to happen
 i used to be well into conspiracy shit
 i even used to work for an online conspiracy bookshop
 but i just thought it was funny
 You fucking what?
 Nah not into them really Sam
 hahaha
 it was called green man books
 or something like that
 they sold conspiracy and wicca books online
 If you have a recommendation im all ears
 i worked in the warehouse and packed up orders to ship to retards in london
   download something called the invisibles
 Sure will boss
 it's about a little shit of a kid from liverpool who takes a bunch of lsd and dmt with a tramp and ends up in some mad multidimensional war between good and evil
 all the good people are gangsters or punks
 all the evil people are upperclass fox hunters
 it's really trippy. the guy who wrote it is some mad stoner from glasgow
 it's genuinely life changing in a very relatable way to your aspartame question
 Ahhh beautiful

 How did that warrant an "article" in the sun though? There is a chance she's right, and an even higher chance she's a numpty. Foregone conclusion
 Yet another reason to show they are on the side of the working class?
 Nahh
 It's to get those page numbers up
 The more articles u have the more as revenue u get
 *ad revenue
 The sun is just another buzzfeed
 That Hetty girls art is sad tho... Its pretty exemplary of what's coming out of art schools tho
 In London at least
 Put a 'I don't care' trying to be funny in-joke vibe to cover up how shallow you are and how u have no real idea why you are painting

 What do they expect tho... They let a bunch of kids who can draw in to do a degree without asking whether they can even read or write

 <Media omitted>
 can you translate this to space raiders?
 Space raiders haven't inflated quite as much tho
 i trust the good people at kp to raise prices along with inflation.
 cadbury are clearly just stealing pocket money at this point
 Never knew space raiders were KP always thought they were their own thing
 Clearly
 Cadbury are scum
 Now they're part yank
 explains it all
 <Media omitted>

 hold tight the maize
 Tangy Toms yo
 Shout out to maize
 Yeah tangy toms were bangin
 What were the other ones alongside tt's?
 i looked into buying a bunch of these things a while back, seeing as you can't find them anymore. amazon do not come with the good prices
 although i think the quarterbacks you can buy direct
 Haha that freddo meme is top
 lcsa x maize
 Backing it
 Bobby's snacks go hard in the paint
 Yeah shout out to bobby
 <Media omitted>
 let's get some tangy tims made. they can have a cartoon tim on the front and taste of last nights cocaine and uber
 Hahaha
 Hahahahahah
 i'll leave the packaging design with you tom
 Tastes like cocaine and 90's aluminium
 ðŸ˜‚
 you're flavour is better than mine
 Thanks
 i hand the business over to you
 There's only two shapes in the bag
 A nose and a wheel
 And they must be aged to the point of going stale for 2 years in a warehouse before shipping
 NOS
 All God tier crisps mentioned
 *maize based snack
 You men know your snacks
 Yeah they gotta be called that because they have 0% potato in them
 Just maize and air baby
 Might flip the script here but shout-out pringles paprika
 anything paprika is bless
 A rare but entirely valid choice
 but ain't nobody got money for pringles
 Discos, Roysters.. I could go on
 big up the happy shopper
 Please do
 Follow my man today_im_eating_crisps on Instagram
 Basically
 ðŸ˜‚
 I remember you showing me that actually Tom

 Pre New labour zest

 Don't do it Jake
 Had one before.. it's almost exactly as you'd imagine
 Send her back
 Like a year 7 cookery class trying to make sausage rolls and then chucking a pizza in the middle
 That being said.. it's great because it's an unruly pizza product
 <Media omitted>
 ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
 I wasn't allowed in a kitchen in school
 But also my school didn't have kitchens so ðŸ¤·â€

 Jake, pls no
 Not gonna be in tomorrow
 Gonna be shitting out hot dog crusts all morning
 <Media omitted>
 Slightly relevant.
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Make Tims crisps taste like that smells
 Dog shit with essence of spunk
 That's horrible
 Hahah
 Tim, this that dog life you wanna sign yourself up for
 Me too
 Except my dog would be about the same size as the sock
 So nothing to worry about

 Especially the Pomeranians

 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜°
 <Media omitted>
 How's that for a working class meal hetty you fuckin scrub
 ðŸ˜‚ didn't even use the dole money to buy it
 Ahahaha
 That pizza doesn't look right
 What's the verdict?
 I like it
 But I'm a big fan of awful food
 So ur mileage may vary
 Also have a sriracha n mayo combo on deck for the crust which is aight
 Part of me wanted to take apart the crust and see if it's one giant sausage running through it
 My thoughts
 Would have been worth it
 Does it?
 I don't think it'd be economically viable to make a special hot dog just for this pizza
 From slice by slice analysis it looks like it actually is
 Can't be
 U have to check now
 Anythings economically viable when the meat is of this low quality
 True
 If it was seamless
 Resale value tho
 I would be impressed
 Years ago
 Don't judge me
 <Media omitted>
 Also I've been stuck at Venice airport since 2pm and the pizza here is shocking
 The worst pizza I ever had was on lake como in italy
 Yes
 Worst pizza, on the main canal in Venice.

 A lot of rubbish pizza in Italy as it goes

 Supposed to be the best pizza in London
 You following my pal The Burger List?
 They're opening one in central soon
 <Media omitted>
 But yeah Fulham and Ealing currently
 Best pizza I've had was in Lewisham
 Can't remember the place though
 Or maybe it was in Lee

 ðŸ˜‚
 Big mark up on pizza
 Used to let you smoke hash in the drury lane one
 <Media omitted>
 The drury lane one is awful
 That's a terrible pizza, doesn't ever compare to icco
 you tell em nic
 not even any cheese
 / hotdog crust
 You guys smoke more then me so I guess your judgement on pizza is more important
 ðŸ˜‚

 we've built a system that pays you money to have mental disorders that prevent you from working
 why would you ever bother
 I can make you a sick promo vid
 Can we start a nofx cover band sam
 Can I shoot the video
 <Media omitted>
 Do a few rancid songs too
 that's what happens when you run a record label
 Seriously I need a job

 You need to hit up kiefer
 You need to smoke some Keif

 :))))?
 Very useful
 I might as well come out now then
 Pls
 No escape
 So, how young will it work from
 ?
 Thank fuck the nazi didn't get a hold of that
 That's mad tho reading that
 So.. being gay shows outwardly in actual facial structure
 Yeah couldn't hack it
 Wasn't that whole study of face structure for criminals disproven
 Still quiet? Man I always regret not going in fair play for rocking up
 Wasn't a fun week
 it's just a camera trained on stereotypically 'gay' people
 I think no one was really vibing this week
 it says that in the article
 although the bit after that about facial sctructure is somewhat interesting
 Well it's experience of gay people was taken from people who are openly gay
 and on a dating site
 From the dating websites yh
 so probably playing up just how gay they look
 Yeah.. they're taking their own photos and trying to attract gay people
 it's interesting that this is being funded though
 I think everyone's loving the neural network shit right now
 Probably why
 yeah
 How it's useful to society tho I don't know
 the trying to pin point gay people by looks alone does seem odd
 i had a play with machine learning a while back
 was trying to make a timbot

 Can u fire him after a day for something petty
 He's gonna fuck that bike up
 Is he gonna be on sprint vans? I heard that he's doing excel pushbike circuit on it with Adam n that
 If so that's perfect timing for me to duck outta there
 You gotta pay deposit for ebukes??
 eBikes, even
 Yeah I'm sure you gotta pay deposit
 He's starting Sprint vans
 Mental
 How the fuck he manage that
 Lol
 I feel for u Nic and Chris
 Shall I change all his dockets to zero moneys
 ðŸ˜‚
 Open channel as well
 Please do
 Yeah good god open channel
 Jay please comment saying that he can pay back Leo then
 Haha
 Whoop whoop
 #cantwaitelectricpoweryeah
 I'd love too Ben, but I'd rather not the conversation.
 Ach
 Yeah Nice gonna be back with us
 Just make sure he earns the exact amount he owes a week til he gets the picture
 He's gonna right off the bike soon enough
 For sure
 He's gonna leave his actual crack bike in the yard all day ðŸ˜‚
 You lot gotta let them tyres down
 Every man chuck a lock on it until he pays Leo
 Without fail
 He's on some bait stolen bike at the moment init
 Some specialised
 Init crack head spesh
 Looked like some decent hybrid
 Black one?
 Man this is quite odd for you controllers though is it not?
 People you sacked getting work on another sprint circuit
 Has he got a bad history with sprint?
 I thought he did. Might be wrong through
 How much does he owe Leo
 Mate I say Leo goes leather lane and tucks this fucker in
 Little crack rabbit
 He owes him all the money for two frames
 However much that is i say you take his bike and then tuck him in
 Take his crack
 Put him to ðŸ˜´
 Didn't he spawn?
 Jus chuck locks at his head
 Man spawned 7 times

 Get me out of here
 Dre?
 Ashe
 <Media omitted>
 Shut up Uneek
 hahahaha
 is that the uniform?
 I got that too haha
 Yeah the t shirt labels
 says it all really
 Ashe is chatting shit about excel
 I swear they're the only reason he still has a job here?
 ask him why he scammed a bunch of random kids with a fake company
 I'm keeping quiet
 He's 100% a psychopath
 i don't reckon
 i would guess some form of schizophrenia
 Yeah I can see that
 He's tweaking just spouting shit constantly
 first time i met him he told me he was eddy merckx son
 We tried to get info about this shit to get him fired and you kept fucking quiet.
 So did everyome
 ?
 Yeah man
 No one had any evidence or proof
 It was all hearsay
 JP come in giving it, then bottled it
 Steph done the same
 i would imagine most of it is hearsay
 Speak to Alex Mellotron n Keiran
 Weren't they leading the witch hunt for this dude?
 Surely they have some proof/facts/whatever
 but he employed a few rookie kids who he 'trained' without payment
 *groomed
 ðŸ˜”
 i have no idea who those people were though.
 leather lane types
 has nobody at sprint spoken to him?
 i genuinely can't understand how he could survive a 2 minute conversation without being sectioned
 Because everyone in the building just wants to avoid him
 ðŸ˜‚
 fair enough
 Honestly
 but someone must have spoken to him
 surely he must have said "i'm princess diana" to somebody
 I'm desperate to fight fire with fire
 Can't Kevin re-ban bubbles
 But I'm also desperate to not totally waste my lunch break
 Kevin wants to Chris.
 Plant a pipe somewhere on the bullitt
 Maybe just in the bag on the front is fine
 Feel free to smoke it first so it looks used
   is it excel merge day? Or are u joining early
 Oh yeah I'll just use my favourite crack pipe
 Make one in your lunch break ha
 does anyone in this chat remember the creative girl who worked sprint and apparently got sacked for smoking crack in a clients bathroom
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 always found that really funny and would love to know if it's true
 He'll self destruct soon enough
 jesus fuck it's cold today
 I heard Ashe say something about an emergency fund
 he set up an alternative lcef
 and steph went ducking mental
 i think the fraud claims were because he said he had a bunch of money off some people
 but that was most likely delusion
 Yeah I'm sneaking over
 Royales came in ðŸ˜°

 Lmao
 There was one in CEX peckham for like Â£30

 Fair
 Is there not an app
 can't use phones in exams
 Ah yes
 really annoying tbh
 shouldn't really have to ever buy a calculator in this day
 Yeah but can't have you cheating now
 Tsk tsk
 Also the fact they still cost double digits
 yeah it's nonsense
 99p for a normal one and a 5er for a fancy one

 having a phone wouldn't ever help you cheat anyway

 Ban women in de streets
 Ban the burka
 Get Sharia law going

 no death. no injuries.

 Na, come to work you scabs.
 oh what, and get by a cyclist?
 fuck off
 im not gettin killed by no cyclist.
 i charlie allistoned a pigeon in burgess park on monday
 You lot are the cyclism killers
 Amazing
 We need to make j walking illegal
 "I'll Charlie Alliston you, you cunt"
 And walking along on your phone. All problems would be solved.
 they could just bring back the superted advert that teaches you to cross the road
 ban ten toes
 no need to make anything illegal really
 King of the road?

 There's like 5 people from overseas that would come
 So it's nothing major, plus people from here
 ðŸ˜‚
 Yeah right
 There's like all the Bristol crew as well
 So like 20 folks dunno
 might be a hard sell. most people are off work at that time so unmotivated to get involved
 Yeah true, see what happens
 don't bother with limehouse. it's fucking huge do not worth it
 it's sort of a bad night to try organise something though unless what you're organising is massive
 too much money to be made by not hosting some scumbags
 Haha yeah guess makes sense
 Might just do something at my place for few folks
 that's honestly the best bet

 Google Maps tracking everything including the name of the fucking restaurant you're at.
 you can turn that off
 Sneaky. Might do that.
 Imagine a gf seeing it if you're being naughty haha.
 it's a true dilemma though
 turn it off, and google won't be so wonderfully accurate when you type '2' into maps and it somehow knows you're looking for '249b kings road'
 i switched it off years ago but it was cool seeing all the data they had
 Whattt
 How you find that shit out?
 Haha yeah fair. It is handy
 the accuracy shouldn't change nowadays
 they've had years to work all this shit out

 Where ever he goes, still getting his shit pushed in
 How old is he?
 If he wasn't such a little cunt it could have been better. But he didn't know she was gonna die a week later.
 The forum stuff changed a lot of this.
 Think he's 18? So might not have been at the time maybe?
 Everyone seems to forget that the chances of death in this incident are incredibly slim. Cyclist at under 20mph. 99% or the time you could have a car drive into you st that speed and not die.
 This
 He's like 20 now, accident was 2 year ago
 Kid was just so incredibly unlucky.
 And acted like a shit.
 It was that long ago?!
 He's lucky if he was 21 he'd be in big man jail
 Small man jail isn't any easier matey

 A third firm, Pink Express, ceased trading in 2014, a year before the time Alliston said he worked for them.
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 That's amazing
 Won't make it to mainstream though
 Hating couriers is easy and fun
 Yeah they're prob bored of that case now
 hahahaha blessed pink
 that's bullshit though really
 you can work at a-z mach-1 etc and they claim you work for pink
 this is great though
 mans trying to get that extended mess cred while under oath!
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 I hope he's realised most couriers think he's a knob
 Oh fantastic
 I'm sure A to Z will have him

 What are the 2 companies run by brothers again?
 Cyclone
 And cyc ain't it?
 Something like that
 i don't think so

 cyc started because the guy was sacked

 maybe though
 i sort of imagine it being more random companies. like chain gang

 Stopped at the lights

 Happened the other day
 Jesus Christ
 I can't remember exactly when
 I've almost had so many fights in that cycle lane
 Like for real
 Gertie is such a gent
 Yeah me too
 Anything happen further?
 I don't have him on FaceyB, apparently he mentioned it there
 Someone check for me
 Pedestrians pulled the bloke off
 All the roadmen shopping on Oxford st park there and bare dumb contractors too, plus everyone stepping out
 He went saville row nick and made a statement
 Damn
 Yeah, couldn't happen to a nicer bloke
 Init
 Think there's cctv on that strip tho, I remember when I Deliveroo guy took out some woman who stepped out
 (Except you Tom, you're nicest)
 He's only gone for Gertrude cos he's tiny, blokes a bully init
 He once had a check point at his house during alleycat and him and his misses were smashing chop
 He's a proper chop head
 Hahaha
 Race ends there
 You ever see him on the weeekend? Mini leather daddy

 El patron ðŸ˜­
 I know you brothers know about it
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Thinking bout them bin beans
 Abokado.. Pedro will tell you more
 Eat and coco Di mama in general
 Just check the closing times of the Ones you pass by
 And be there
 You can usually get more stuff of shops that close after 7/8pm
 Yeah eat around Mayfair used to have loads. And one of those big sushi places, forgot the name. One by Vogue House.
 Sainsbury's opposite Waterloo always used to come thru
 Round the back hop the black gates
 i donâ€™t know if they still do. but eat would just give you food at end of day
 Arun, express your thoughts on this topic.
 all the places on kingsway and that area of high ho are usually goldmines
 a lot of places in london get genuinely raided by the homeless and you can feel like a prick grabbing food like the filthy liberal you are when you could just buy it
 Please Tim
 Considering no one in this chat goes to work and we're all one lay away from the street I reckon it's just
 Someone once try give me a seafood bin raided meal and I was like are you nuts
 Everything else is kosher though
 in reality there is plenty to go round. but parasitic liberal â€˜freeganâ€™ fuckwits just grab everything. filthy hippies
 iâ€™m mostly joking and donâ€™t care
 but iâ€™ve seen some funny fights break out between squat scum and genuine homeless
 Haha
 Yeah I went golden sq and saw homeless going through it so I rode off
 Paying full wack in pret now

 This is all great.
 Squat scum, what a rude term

 i was one of the squat rats
 itâ€™s a fair statement
 we were all scum

 I have never squatted but I would
 fucking hippy
 go move in with ojay
 share a room with pikey

 Nah I'm part of society not a dreg

 Are we doing Indian veg?
 BYOB cheap as fuck
 Word
 If you can afford food don't take it from people who can't
 Let bin raiders be bin raiders
 That's it
 Stop it you lot.
 Mate that shit in the city sits there
 Maybe not west end but I seen it
 Is it worse than racking food?
 I skipped for food when I was skint and it felt like my best option for eating
 There really is plenty to go around it's fucked what shops chuck out
 Racking is different
 There's an element of fun to it
 @bantsldn
 Haha
 And lest not forget it's how you gain clout boys
 Yeah the finesse game is addictive
 Finesssse
 But I see it as the best way to save money as well
 Even if I had money I would finesse mate
 Yeah fair enough to save money
 Who was that celeb who got caught racking cheese from tesco

 I learn so many new terms here it's great
 Robbing food is great though.
 You can't et caught mate
 That's not fun
 Robbing expensive stuff is cool to
 Not that I steal or condone any sort of act
 That finesse life
 Stealing>bin raiding
 It's kinda true. We can get away with robbing food more than a homeless breh
 I saw a homeless guy get caught racking two boxes of macaroons from fortnum & mason yesterday lol
 What do you say there?
 Take me to the warm room with food and tea mate yeah cheers
 It was actually peak though the security were out of order

 So is Uber done?
 Whaaat
 Tha programme is fuckin hilarious
 Uber lost license why
 Big up Addie lee
 Yeah word joss lool
 I bang that out lool man
 Wow so what happened?
 That's kind of a shame because loads of jobs losses
 Yeah truss I love uber
 But fucking well done TfL. Made the right move for once.
 Yeh for sure
 Now I'm going to have to even more chop and walk home now
 Damn it
 That's banging
 rahted. kinda sick but allow night buses
 why has this happened?
 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41358640
 TfL said theyre not fit to have a license
 Correctly.
 Yeah for sure
 They're some of the worst drivers on the road
 >some
 Adi lee must be so relieved
 Yeah some lol
 So are black cabs
 thereâ€™s lots of shit drivers on the road
 Yeah I mean they're all shit
 But uber doesn't have exclusivity when it comes to shit drivers
 95% of cabbies are excellent drivers.
 Loads of addi lee's are terrible too
 loads of cabbies are shit too
 some arenâ€™t
 everyones shit
 cyclists are the problem
 but uberâ€™s driving skills arenâ€™t why theyâ€™ve been shut down
 did you not hear about the murderous illegal cyclists
 is this just the work of black cabs?
 some shady back room dealings
 probably
 I don't think there are any conspiracies here
 I swear black cabbies have been protesting about their rates and shit though
 I dunno if they're that close with TfL either
 but whatâ€™s the reason
 They're taking the piss out of tfl's loop holes, course they hate them
 that article basically says â€œthey ainâ€™t puckaâ€
 in what regard? i know nothing of tfl or how uber operate
 I don't know the specific details... the 10 minutes between booking an uber and it coming
 That's a rule of a private hire cab, there has to be a certain amount of time between you booking the taxi and it arriving. They often break this rule apparently
 Apart from the fact driving along on a while using a phone is illegal. but for some reason people are allowed to build a business around doing just that.
 they click a button at the start of a journey and one at the end
 itâ€™s just sat nav
 like every cabbie in london
 https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/26/ubers-london-licence-renewed-for-only-four-months
 Every single cabbie in London uses a phone?
 I don't think so
 i donâ€™t have any data on that. but a decent amount of cabbies iâ€™ve seen have the same setup as uber
 a lot use the phones to work out the cost of the trip
 just seems like cabbies trying to run a monopoly
 Well if you were a cabbie who bought a Â£40.000 taxi and spent three years of his life training to be a cabbie and someone comes in and completely undercuts you and the tfl tells you that you aren't allowed to then combat that by dropping your rates, what are you going to do other than complain?!
 You can't keeping linking his back to cabbies. They're just doing what anybody would do in their situation..... trying to keep their job and livelihood.
 Yeah I hate em both but I'm on the side of the cabs
 so if technology comes along to drastically improve an archaic service in terms of a consumer it shouldnâ€™t be allowed?
 Not if it causes this many problems
 What's wrong with throwing your hand in the air and paying a properly self employed person a little more to take you somewhere
 If you want to get someone to take you somewhere, it's not going to be cheap
 I'm sure dial a cab or get it do deals near enough to uber prices.
 possibly so
 but uber had a really streamlined and useful service
 millions of people would use and love it
 And the car ownership in London has gone up by some ridiculous percentage
 When TfL has been campaigning for years to stop people driving in the city.
 Your fault for investing so much in a job any fool can do with an iPhone and a prius
 Being a cabbie is a totally dead job. You may as well be a coalminer. Literally 2/3s of cabs have no one in yet they all cream like 30k+
 We don't need a more congested city.
 True though, Gett is the perfect combo
 I don't even believe in adi lee
 Everyone download Gett. I've probably got a discount code
 What's get
 If you're an HGV driver, you have to take a stupid test.
 If you're a cabbie you have to take a test.
 Black cabs but with uber-like interface. Actually predates Uber, I reckon
 What about if you're a courier?
 Everyone should have a propper licence to carry people, whether it's a black cab licence or something else. People should be checked and licenced to make sure they can competently do the job.
 Driving license?
 I mean there's no extra skills involved in having people in the back seat
 (noodle was contemplating working for Uber)
 You are responsible to that persons wellbeing whilst they are in your car.
 And the amount of uber accidents I have seen with my own eyes, let alone the rest of the ones I don't see, demonstrates that some of them aren't capable of completing the simple task of taking someone from A to B
 Let alone driving on busy London roads with cyclists, HGV's and more complicated road networks.
 I back black cabs but they're too expensive and racist
 What would you see that they're expected to do over and beyond a normal driver is expected?
 so when automated cars are a thing in say 10-20 years, that will better because itâ€™s safer. so youâ€™ll be happy that the cabbies donâ€™t have a business model and go extinct
 Orange cone slalom course?
 Reverse handbrake turn
 ??
 Drifting
 Carry a passenger..
 Who is paying a fare
 Would pay a premium for drift skillz
 To you
 So, what's gonna be in the test
 Don't slam the doors?
 should the vehicles be specifically licensed for passenger safety too?
 Probably. Extra wide seatbelts
 whatâ€™s the crumple zone situation in a black cab?
 Roll cages maybe
 ðŸ˜‚
 iâ€™m being serious though
 as a passenger youâ€™re safer in a prius than with some of the old shit mobiles the ageing cabbies use
 although i assume modern black cabs are designed in a similar style to other cars and probably as safe
 If people are happy to pay extra for the service of a black cab then all power to them
 yep
 But to shout and scream about the competition when it arrives
 With a better business model
 Instead of adapting ..
 but consumer choice is a wonderful thing
 Yeah it is
 They can't adapt chris
 Darwinism init
 That's the whole point of their arguement.
 so should they not protest the people who set the rules
 So ... Move on ? Who owes them anything?
 and not just moan because a different company offers an attractive service
 The selfless service they've provided to the citizenship of london
 The amount of sweeping statements being made is outrageous in this conversation
 youâ€™ve made quite a few yourself nic
 Shout outs to racism, lbc 97.3,  green coffee huts, an inability to adapt to current technology and poor driving
 I'll take Chris's point of view here "fuck'em, should have known better than to invest all their money in a dodger business plan."
 ðŸ¤·â€
â™‚
 U don't get my point of view tho
 It's not mine
 I'm applying yours to their situation
 People lobbying for legislation change to benefit themselves over competition isn't right
 ^
 this
 We'll, u don't get my point of view like I said
 This is the result
 So in that case, uber shouldn't fight it
 Hey should just leave it alone.
 Because they aren't allowed to change legislation to benefit their drivers?
 You don't really bring any consideration of what other people are saying
 So what's the point
 they donâ€™t need to change anything
 they existed
 ltda were lobbying for changes to bully out uber
 They existed possibly by bending the rules a bit in their favour and TfL taking a leanient attitude to their operations.
 did they break anything accept the 10 minute rule?
 Imagine vans lobbying to ban cargo bikes
 because ..... ummmm.... is quite like to be picked up in less than 10 mins
 thatâ€™s a quality service
 No, it's a 10 minute break in between drop off and pick up
 ah
 like an anti hustle rule
 It's a law to separate minicabs from black taxis
 As I said earlier, I'm not saying I know all the rules, I'm just saying an example of one I know about
 U pay for the cab + the license, u get that benefit
 The article someone posted talked about what I just said
 So, the law chooses one group over another
 The law chooses the group that are in favour, rather than one that might bend the rules
 Ofcourse
 What?
 No it should never work like that
 The law should then favour the police over the criminal
 That would work a treat right?
 A biased law
 What are you even saying
 this is borin. back to postin almonds plz
 You're taking this wildly out of context man
 Law shouldn't favour one group over another
 It's discrimination
 I can't even be bothered anymore
 Crab emoji tree emoji question mark
 ok into the next debate..... how do people feel about the closing of coal mines and the rise of alternative energy sources like nuclear and hydroelectric

 Oh lord give me strength
 Very painful
 Can't cope
 How do you win?

 nah, train sim is the one
 you win by successfully completing the tube run on time
 Is there an occasional line closure where everyone gets angry
 hahaha
 lots of red signals
 And you have to prep a speech?
 and you have to type in the codes for all the tannoy announcements
 If you make too many mistakes you start working as a bus driver
 Or repair tracks

 iâ€™ve made a couple of computer games before
 and i always wanted to make a courier one

 where you just tell couriers where to go all day

 Need a lot of stupid telephone conversations
 A year needed just for that
 riders mysteriously stopping mid run and having to find out what theyâ€™re up to
 lots of people complaining they donâ€™t earn enough and going home
 i think it would be nice and stressful

   did you ever play company of heroes or do you only like first person war?
 <Media omitted>
 Oh man I got a bookful of bullshit if you're interested
 I don't know what company heroes is
 yes, make a zine
 it was a real time strategy game based on the d-day landing and march to berlin
 fucking perfect multiplayer
 we used to play it a bit at cable
 Red alert the only similar shit I was playing online
 Miss it
 yeah
 it is red alert but more modern, more fluid controls and less bullshit
 and all the little characters swear constantly
 ðŸ‘

 each player can pick a specialisation for their squads to give you really badass weapons
 if youâ€™re playing as the nazis you can pick to just use propaganda and then have loops of uplifting german speeches being played all over the battlefield
 Who's op
 Or abit more even
 if youâ€™re asking whoâ€™s overpowered then the answer is that the game is pretty much perfectly balanced. if youâ€™re not then ignore.
 Good, might try then
 Would be a laugh to find another reason not to come out
 itâ€™s windows only
 I'm one of them
 :)))))
 Cheapskate
 but the team that make it now make dawn of war 1/2/3

 Get it set into your teeth
 If I believe in it enough maybe it will be a diamond
 I think that's the whole diamond industry in a nutshell
 Loool
 A diamond ring and its significance is solely in the eyes of the beholder
 Now that u can make diamonds too
 Just a shitty bit of compressed rock set in a cheap bit of precious metal... Gorgeous
 Innit, super compress some peanut butter and voila... You're Barry De Beers
 Pretty much it isn't it
 Get de beers in bazza
 marketing and stashing the worlds supply so that you artificially increase rarity does wonders for profit margin
 Hmm to be honest these was actually a pretty good radio 4 show in defence of the value of diamonds
 Digital human
 if you want a truly valuable product, get a stash of sand and sit on it for a while
 cash in when the semiconductor industry runs out
 helium is another safe bet
 Cheers
 Will keep a bag of sand on ice
 thatâ€™s even wiser, water is rare too
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 Bardy
 Ah ok
 Truuu
 Yeah that red stitching is great though
 To be fair
 Diamond setting and Jewellery handling/making are very hard tasks, look at the rings on Toms finger
 that's what you pay a lot for
 If you found just one it's not that sick loool
 If you found Toms hand, now we're talking
 My hand*
 Sorry
 That was directed at Sam
 It's ok don't worry
 You might get a Benz for it
 Whether it's Mercedes or cannabis
 I can't tell you, I'm Tom Brady
 ðŸ˜‚
 I'm on 14 dockets what the fuck
 ðŸ˜‚
 Just call the guy man
 That Tim Westwood freshers event looks lit
 Lit=\= mentally weak white girls from Dover
 Haha
 Word
 "What's a xanox"
 "In my city we only have ket and meth not coke"
 I wonder what gok can bring to the table
 Town*
 Loool
 I'm not sure there is a lot Gok could bring to a table that'd make me hungry if Tim had already set his side of the table to
 Sometimes to baffle me Arun
 Even without Tim, I don't think Gok is going to appetise me
 Sometimes?
 Wow that's a first
 Always haha
 Tishi actually met him the other day apparently he is a top geezer
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 my sides
 Who Gok?
 I have no doubts Gok is a diamond geezer (no pun!!!!)
 Even if he does nosh cock
 However Tim Westwood is on my level of being the ðŸ
 Hahahaha
 I may have changed my name but the man in the photo for the chat is me
 I'm living in secret
 Seriously who added half of these silent fuckers into this chat
 Runin for that touchdown
 One of their numbers starts with 31 6 :/
 Always for the touchdown
 whatâ€™s tom brady ever done?
 ðŸ¦ðŸ
 you should be dock ellis
 Tom Brady, ðŸ˜, gunslinger, ðŸ.
 â€œEllis threw a no-hitter on June 12, 1970, and later stated that he accomplished the feat under the influence of LSDâ€
 Fair enough
 If that is 70-71 season, he won a World Series
 That year
 Tom Brady
 I* have done so many great things
 I'm in Family Guy mate
 That's when the rings don't matter
 also mentioned in its always sunny
 Tom Brady is mentioned everywhere, anywhere, ever.
 Plus Philadelphia have the worst luck in sports I think lool
 speaking of always sunny
 what about wade boggs for goat
 â€œThe former third baseman was practically a character out of Greek mythology when it came to downing Miller Lites, and for years rumor had it that he once put back 64 cold ones during a single road trip. In January, we learned this wasn't true... It was actually 107.â€
 Looooool
 If he's got rings, he's up there
 Tom is the ðŸ˜because he is Tom much like Michael Jordan is Michael
 Joe Montana could be the ðŸ to but I mean what's he done
 Outside of ðŸ?
 You in Family Guy nigga? No.
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Oh my
 Scottie Pippen wasn't the ðŸ
 He still has a Nike shoe tho
 ace ventura
 No way is joe Montana in ace Ventura lol
 He's like an American Daniel Craig tbh
 <Media omitted>
 youâ€™re right
 iâ€™m thinking of dan marino
 Yeah then he would've be no
 He beat Dan Marino in that game
 Oh lol they're taking the piss out of Dan Marino I c
 Perfect example of why Tom is the ðŸ˜
 Regular season stats are cool, but I'll take the ðŸ’
.
Somebody should've said this to Dan Marino
 Dan Marino kissed a guy/girl
 Even more reason why Tom is the ðŸ˜
 <Media omitted>
 He doesn't have to miss men/women he has a pengting
 And can rock long OR short hair
 Enough about goats
 Why have u got a crush on this guy
 It's cool seeing people snapping couriers and most of them wearing a ten bag now
 Why are you even speaking?
 Ur in love with a 40 year old American football player
 And a retired basketball player
 Ur in love with a white girl
 Have I ever tried to character assassinate you on that?
 If u had a chance at 1 night with him
 Would u take it
 1 hotel room
 If tom Brady was a woman he could have my children
 A bag full of drugs
 I would double team his wife with him
 ðŸ‘ª this yeah
 You just continue delivering those ðŸ“¦ bud ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Don't worry about my obsessions now
 Brad Pitt, another ðŸ
 Would double team his wife with him to
 Brad Pitt is in the closet mate
 Michael Jordan, would double team his wife too
 Your issues with homophobia are not my problem matey
 ðŸ¤·ðŸâ€
â™€
 No issue mate.. just a bit strange your celeb role models all seem to include a sexual fascination
 "and their wives" ok
 ðŸ˜‚
 you're the one asking about bags full of drugs, one night in a hotel room...
 Insinuating it's your fantasy, not mine
 I just look up to these people and Sam asked me a questiob
 However wow look at MJ's wife
 I can't load the photo but she's mixed race and very peng
 ðŸ’?
 You in Family Guy nigga? No.

 But yeah let's face it all you lot do is talk shit about letters and packages
 I'd prefer to talk about greatness
 I win
 I prefer not to talk, I win
 Don't suffer in silence Armin
 As we've gathered here, it's more fun when every bodies involved ;)
 Serious tho.. what's the deep interest in a guy who is so disconnected from life your own
 Life
 Oh no, I just trap them tings
 Oh I see
 Yeah I'll give you that one Armin
 Tom brady.. American football.. priveliged college life
 Wins at sports
 143 unread msgs
 Loool Chris you're just purposely trying to be a pedant matey
 Don't ask stupid questions
 agreed. i was enjoying the rare earth materials chat. messlife is very dull
 Genuine
 Tom Brady, Michael Jordan, all greatness
 Question. What's the personal connection
 Come on it's got to be more than that
 I aspire to greatness but not in the NBA or NFL
 That's boring
 problem?
 Yeah
 If mj and Brady would have a baby young a would be it
 Well then shut up and deal with it
 Because I don't give a fuck ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸðŸðŸ
 It's like loving Migos cause u wanna have gold chains
 U wanna have money? Love that guy who made facebook
 But... Why tom brady
 Sports isn't easy mate
 You've got a bad back and you're 25 or some shot
 I do respect the guy who made Facebook
 But is he 40 and has been tackled numerous times but still on top form...?
 U don't really have an answer, that's why u tryna have a go
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Yh im 25 so what.. I'm asking
 Cause u go on about using him alot
 *not using
 Nah you're just talking shit and I'm bored enough to entertain it
 Ok
 ðŸ
¿
 About not using him?
 Never heard u talk about American football
 Or support a team
 So why tom.brady?
 I've answered this matey
 I'm surprised your struggling
 Cause he's a winner?
 On paper
 And on paper is what counts in sports
 Regular season don't count, I'll take the rings ;)
 And on paper tom is the host
 ðŸ˜
 For the record to, I watch a lot of NFL, and support the Ny Giants, who tom Brady doesn't play for ;)
 can he really be considered the goat goat though.... heâ€™ll be forgotten
 he hasnâ€™t contributed enough to be remembered
 What does it matter
 even shaq warned a phd and contributed to human knowledge. although admittedly he still has time
 I weren't talking about him or his stats
 *earned
 On paper
 Why does Arun care? He chats alot about him
 Well I would chat a lot about Michael Jordan or shaq but quite frankly, I prefer NFL to NBA
 Joe Montana wasn't forgotten and he has less rings than Brady  
 iâ€™m just trying to see your criteria for GOAT
 i mean forgotten in a longer scope
 And like I said my criteria isn't based on all that other exterior shit
 It's based on rings
 If you're a football player what do or should you care for all that wank?
 I think you're spending too much time questioning who I idolise honestly  
 Ok, maybe I am
 But yeah
 I'm sorry
 I had no idea who u were on about
 I hope I passed your test of who I can idolise as greatness and look upto mate
 U can do what u like!
 Just when u go on about him I have no clue why ur telling it to all us
 Its just words to me
 About a guy on a another continent who lived his life
 And that's you mate
 As Tim said nobody understands what I'm saying
 I do what I like anyway also loool
 I just hope I passed your test you know it means something to me
 Also, google is your friend
 Yh I know I found out alot on Wikipedia about him
 Arun try Valentino Rossi out
 Literally the goat
 There you go
 The best thing to ever happen to motorcycling
 Had you not attempted to character assassinate me with the homophobic shit maybe the discussion would've gone differently ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Yeah word I'll
 Bill*
 I can get some bored of that like cycling tho
 same with NBA the ending is good (usually) but the rest stagnant
 Bill hasn't thought to promote his name endlessly tho
 NBA banter on insta is half my feed
 So jokes
   whoâ€™s the neekball goat? whoâ€™s got the rings
 Yeah word Tim loool
 Yeah and I do Chris
 Sorry if that's a problem matey
 Just gets a bit long to read is all
 Just like listening to you 'genuinely ask' Piet why he likes Supreme used to get a bit long yeah? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ™ƒðŸ˜‰
 See how u attack mat e
 Wink wink crying laugh face
 donâ€™t take the bait chris, youâ€™re ðŸ˜ conversation maker
 At least have a chat don't be insecure
 Lool
 I think you're insecure or you would've just asked me why I like tom brady instead of mentioning hotel rooms and drugs
 But there you go, we all have opinions innit mate
 Wink wink, crying laughter face
 Ah it's just my way of going on about it
 And that is mine ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‰ðŸ™ƒ
 If you talk about a guy so much there must be love in there somewhere
 But I guess it flew over your heaf
 Yeah mate definitely
 Totally agree
 are you enrolling tomorrow arun?
 Don't start fires you can't put out mate I'll handle this one and refrain from answering now
 Sorry if I made anyone here uncomfortable with this debate or talking about Tom Brady aswell x
 Indeed Sam
 ðŸ‘Chris: ðŸ˜‚ðŸ™ƒðŸ˜‰
 And I'm the 19 year old lol
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‰ðŸ™ƒðŸ˜‰ðŸ™ƒðŸ˜‚
 ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
 It's true lool
 Don't see me complaining about it
 I don't feel the need to tell u about it
 I quote myself
 Alot of things I think I keep to myself. But keep on talking mate
 Talk is cheap is how the saying goes
 Ouch that one hurt man
 I don't wanna hurt u tho
 Why would I?
 The emojis are so you don't get butt hurt, because this is all a joke to me
 Jeffrey just asked me and Pete if we want Bubbles
 ðŸ˜‚
 I think you're taking it a little to seriously
 Vans wants rid already
 And trying to be a little to clever
 I get it, I'm 19 and your older, so your right g
 Nah I'll talk to u in private
 I'm sorry man
 Should've never defied you or mentioned the greatest quarterback to ever grace the NFL
 Tom Brady, not Joe Montana.
 Happy the photo hasn't wavered loool
 Got close with all that mentioning of Ace Ventura
 U man should get a bag of drugs and a hotel room and just hug it out
 ðŸ˜­
 Well Chris wants to talk to me 'in private'
 :/

 i think itâ€™s just a fire
 isis has no beef with lcsa
 (yet)
 elly spoons is mad tonight btw
 loads of students and some sort of antifa meet up
 Yeah just checked twitter looks like a fire

 Haha that place really pops off
 times have changed
 some guy got some tracks that says FTP with the puma logo
 aaaaard
 Antifa at spoons
 theyâ€™ve been taking gang photos and shit
 also, highlight of the day is that i had a lecture earlier called â€˜design and practiceâ€™
 good ole elly
 some guy trying to promote drawing and sketches
 he talked about his experience in industry and then presented a powerpoint about various adult toys he had designed
 my man had the technical drawings of dildos
 yo big don

 Did you not get any pics?
 sorry boss
 the product was called omax
 google
 Wahum
 i googled for you
 <Media omitted>
 mumsnet is too lulz
 Wow that post is over 10 years old
 heâ€™s a lecturer man. iâ€™m sure he was chewed up by the design industry years ago
 The internet sometimes defies time
 I often find posts from uk420 etc which are still relevant to my current situation over 15 years ago
 we had some guy talk to us about how he designed an automated tap valve in his final year so that baths wouldnâ€™t overflow and cause water damage in flats. he went on to show us his appearance on dragons den
 >swim ingested 3 grams of Moroccan haschish 3 hours ago
 hahahahaha
 >tfw erowid
 >swim feels light and happy
 I'm glad you got that Sam
 Doesnâ€™t that little hole work then?
 no
 that canâ€™t cope with the modern pressures of water supplies
 his product was actually very good
 involved a magnetic valve
 he had 3 dragons offer deals and he declined them
 he said he just went on to get exposure
 ended up with like 600K investment
 ðŸ˜­
 andy roy's epicly laterd is insane
 Yep, just watched that on your recommendation. Very solid looney there
 Didn't feel right to be sat still watching it
 Eh   I'm covering your holidays right? Robin rang me last night
 You going to lend me the old ctrl bullit?
 I'm moving into a ground floor flat so will be able to store
 The old beast
 You took it for a service yet?
 That thing was a death trap
 Holidays ain't quite how I'd describe it but yeah. Thought you'd be right on for the job! I apologise in advance for my bullitt but save your grievances til I get back because I know all about them already haha
 Haha it was always rubbish
 Don't worry
 9-20 right?
 I miss robin I don't see him anymore
 I used to go to his house twice a week for dinner
 Do his kids homework work then
 Such a good dude
 He's so lovable but fuckin bat shit crazy. Tha bit when Birdo turns up I thought he was gon kill him
 Miss him a lot
 Yeah, you can sort of blame yourself for some of how bad it is as I assume you rode it a lot at CTRL. Still, I have a new drive chain coming so soon it'll be back up to scratch.
Robin is a great "boss" and I know you'll both enjoy working with each other and hanging out again - that was a lot of the appeal  
 Ha, yeah. Clearly for everyone around him and himself included, not easy to see how to correctly harness all that energy
 I've worked with him before he's lovely and fun to work with
 Hahah abit slow
 But whatever
 It will be fun

 Biggest US mass shooting in recent history
 Yah
 You thinking fasle flag Alex?
 Old white man, no religious ties of beliefs, had 8-10 fully automatic, or modified semi automatic rifles in 2 hotel rooms he shot out out of.
 Not easy to buy one fully auto rifle in America let along 10.
 Mate I think most of this shit is false flat tbf haha.
 Lay off the skunk m8
 All the videos show no blood, no injured, no muzzle flash.
 Easy to modify a legal Ar tho

 Dude was a white country fan shooting up a country music festival?
 Maybe he really hates Jason Aldean.
 Possible
 Maybe he just had serious mental issues
 Nah matey
 If he was a Joe Daki, this would be a terrorise attack walahi adeem
 Alie
 How is killing 50 and injuring 200+ not terrorism
 this
 Regardless of skin
 White guy with a gun in a state with like 2 laws shoots white people
 They're still people lool
 terrorism is using fear to spread an agenda
 ISIS have actually claimed it's an attack
 I reckon they just put their name on anything
 Nah thatâ€™s Edmonton.
 Isis would claim my fart if more than one person left the room
 Nah man
 Hahahahaha jake

 Some people are thinking its to push a ban on guns, so people canâ€™t defend themselves from the state when shit gets 1984 haha. Mad but interesting.

 Why didn't everyone have a Skeng
 Distraction*
 Why isn't this a shootout

 Think bigger maaaaan.
 Presidents donâ€™t control the real shit.
 War on ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡µ?
 War on ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡µ.
 Itâ€™s a bit crazy, but some woman was walking around the concert before it started being like â€œpure all going to die tonightâ€.  Far fetched but interesting eh.
 Bet she had a 9 with a scope on her waist
 the thing is though. theyâ€™ve been saying this same shit about every shooting for years and years. so if youâ€™re inclined to believe thatâ€™s the case, then in reality you have justified to yourself that itâ€™s well past the time to rise up with your militia and do something about it. but they donâ€™t.
 so tbh there is no point having them
 did anyone know epilepsy is to do with electricity?
 Nobody told me that

 Not on their list of duties
 Not if you throw your lid
 I don't even think they can chase you with your lid anymore
 Motorbikes rule the city
 But then your lid has DNA if you're on database
 TFW> don't wear a lid
 >lid = helmet
 There also he only armed police on bike there top boxes are literallty for guns
 Really?
 Did bubbles ever pay leo back btw

 *shudder*
 Imagine
 And what sucks is leo is in a tight spot because his dog fell sick again and he has had to spend all his money on a surgery.
 Yeah true that
 Damn
 Ride out?
 Kick down doors
 I almost think we should set up a go find me thing for dude.
 Gofund*
 Yeh that's not a bad shout
 Yeah that would be cool
 Well let's do it then. I think the bills he had was like a few grand. But his pup is all good now.
 man thatâ€™s shit
 did he not have insurance?
 Didnt cover 100% of the amount
 It was like 4K they covered 2.5K somehing like that
 Not sure on the right values
 yeah ok
 I don't even think that
 I think I should just tuck bubbles in
 But then does he have money lol
 Or crack Leo doesn't even  no crack
 Want*
 Neither do I
 I doubt they'd shoot you in a chase unless you took the queen

 Fuck Feds

 Duh
 It's delicious
 Aldi wine is also bang bang
 Easily rackable if your that way inclined too
 Jake did just say he was gonna buy a rack
 That wine with the yellow and red branding Castillo something always between 7-10quid is a real good red for the money
 Go borough wines
 Buy a glass bottle for 2.50 and they do refills for Â£6
 There's a bottle of Blended scotch in Aldi for Â£14 I'm desperate to buy but dubious
 Borough wines was good
 Actually remembering to bring the bottle out on shop runs was the hard bit though
 Yeh Asda had some banging whiskey on for pretty cheap
 Well good for the price
 Just get it, Jay. Hip flask fodder if nothing else
 Yeah can't go wrong for that price

 Maybe he can back to excel!!
 Fucking hell
 What's he done?
 Is that dean from excel?
 Aaaaaaahahahahahahha
 Deans a cunt though
 Haha
 Init heâ€™s almost as shady as Ashe himself
 Proper cowboy
 I reckon sprint love excel for them reasons you know
 They make sprint look like saints
 ðŸ¤”
 Apart from all the rest of it
 All them old boys at excel are proper Bermondsey Cowboys.
Definitely a couple bushwackers or icf in the mix
 howâ€™d he get sacked?
 Probably lied about something
 Bushwhacker
 Is that millwall?
 Someone told me his whole plan was to build up this e-bike fleet then poach them all for his own company again lol
 Just a rumour but maybe they found out
 After the year of everyone paying for them then theyâ€™ll get shafted by him
 Yeah heâ€™s a scam artist
 Nah Ashe has been hired by another company
 Yeh.
Who was the excel controller wid the bench skull mug n head tatts?
 Lmao
 Of course
 He is a nutter
 But all this shit he's been going on about to me about getting a scheme for couriers to buy cargo bikes
 I contacted some of the people involved to make sure... It all seems legit
 So, I dunno. He appears less sociopathic than some of the decision makers at sprint for all the hate he gets
 Donâ€™t fall into his trap chris
 <Media omitted>
 I need to hit this guy up for help on my CV
 My man's getting jobs thrown at him left right and centre

 Heâ€™s such a don init. Was always a treat when he was on the box
 Do I get to keep this bullitt u think
 I reckon so

 I thought his only job was to â€˜maintainâ€™ them anyway
 Oi frank Lopez saw his at Sloane st he was telling me heâ€™s bare lean

 You lot are getting good at meming. Need an lcsa meme account soon.
 i feel theyâ€™re all a bit too niche
 not really memes
 anything involving the almond cracks me up but i donâ€™t know it translates
 They are actually exactly memes of you go by definition. Evolving from each one more and more.
 But yeah was too exclusive to this group haha.
 yes mr dawkins
 but itâ€™s about shared cultural experience too
 and thatâ€™s what weâ€™re lacking
 call the guy is universal though
 i hope â€˜bless youâ€™ can reach these lofty heights
 ðŸ˜‚ I actually missed the original bless you I think.
 I know it was almond
 Obvz
 you are right though, there is some real nice evolution
 makes me piss myself
 it could only be better if people were screencapping and saving as a shitter format so the image would degrade over time

 in the words of doug stanhope, i will happily berate you for not knowing something i found out about 4 minutes earlier
 This actual one, is made of real parts, real size, real weight. Fucking heavy as
 <Media omitted>
 so these pellets that wiki says you shoot, whatâ€™s the difference to like a .22 air rifle
 my knowledge of guns is limited to farmers shotguns and shooting rats with .22
 It's 6mm
 They're balls
 ah ok, so similar size
 is the velocity similar?
 They're light weight, propelled by air. Light enough to not kill you, but heavy enough to hurt.
 ah
 thatâ€™s badass

 Fucking hell  why are cyclists such cunts
 I had my front wheel in a bike box and the cunt with a go pro was integregating me like a fed

 Jook him.

 Threaten violence

 Don't have it
 Jus soon as any looks at you threaten throw hands.
 No second guess
 Mate bike boxes are fair game for motorbikes in London. Stick to the right and who are you harming? Safer for you too.
 Always going to be some cunts but why are they gonna be on the far right anyway?
 Zero money spent on motorcyclist safety in London so do it your way init.
 Fuck you Alex I'll fight you
 Cheers mate

 i got pissed up with the uni mandem last night watching some student union stand up.
 one of the people on my course is 19 and never had a drink
 he had two pints of fosters and couldnâ€™t stand up anymore
 mad
 Mate that's why people go to uni because they feel they need that place to do things
 true
 a lot of people go so they donâ€™t end up working as bike couriers
 Or you go and end up one :(
 That's what first years all about
 First years marks don't count towards fuck all
 You just gotta pass
 man, if only, the average marks for my course are so shit theyâ€™ve changed the system so first year does count
 go do a random masters and become a banker
 Nah I'm a failure I just got to accept it
 thatâ€™s the spirit
 Billy go back to Tiger ðŸ˜Jay: That sucks. My first year you needed 40% to pass
 same
 but it is included in your overall results
 itâ€™s only like 10% or something
 but still
 Ugh
 i think the world is so desperate for engineers they are just making it easier to pass
 everyone gave up on maths and science so weâ€™re running out of people who know how to make anything
 Yeah lool
 These kids go into k holes after like a bump matey
 Some kid did similar at mine  
 1 drink Danny matey
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Yeah designers don't do what u do and ur kinda right
 No one at my school does engineering really I had an ask/look
 They're all little faggots
   did you go uni? If so what for
 they donâ€™t teach it at goldsmiths
 Lol
 I'm sure there's a similar course with a 'different' name
 I got a 1st class honours in graphic design son
 LOOK AT ME NOW

 Lean against some stuff
 Last time I took k I was seeing tron irl
 Then rode back to colchester on my Honda zoomer at 5am
 Ah nostalgia
   you remember when we had the big meet up at the foundry spot a few years ago. maybe when ken died? and like a million people were just ketted laying out on the street
 red roger talking about being a sniper or something

 Wesley snipes
 Roger gets it man

 Mate
 Arun you were too xanned to get into phonox
 I came up like a right cunt
 Hahahah oh yeah
 Loooool

 I think I piped some illiterate slut
 Cunts ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 You were trying to sing along to drill in the uber but the xans has you slurring your words so funny
 You most likely just melted into Brixton high road
 Hahahaha
 Nah I did something really good man
 I want to know what ffs
 I think I got banned from Amersham I dunno
 Hahaha trust fuck xanax
 Nobody takes them anymore since my boy had a seizure o.O
 Dark
 KIDS. DONT TAKE XANAX
 Yeah theyâ€™re kinda mad
 I just never remember anythin
 I ainâ€™t about that feeling
 That's what most drugs do
 But yeah they're dark
 Prior to pop belief I never did and don't take that many
 But all my pals who's been rehab it's xanax/codeine and cocaine or both
 That's why I exercise something called
 I dunno I usually remember a whole night on pills
 I love money, extreme self control
 It's a power
 Unless I proper over do it
 Hahahah init
 I came back from the dead last time I did and wacked lines with my eyes closed in my boxers
 Naughty
 He did do that
 Me and Ollie did kind of give you it
 But I'm not you ðŸ¤·ðŸâ€
â™€
 Ellis I think everyone's different
 But xanax does the same to everyone regardless
 Yeah true
 Instant wave
 Same with any prewcript on
 Prescription
 Depends what you wanna mix it w innit
 Lemme restoke this and say.. Don't take prescription drugs because they're developed predominantly for profit rather than pleasure?
 Yeah true
 Thereâ€™s a reason big pharma is one of the richest industries
 Okay tom we get it you're clever
 Comon matey tell me something I don't know
 Big pharma knows what he is doing
 Clearly
 Look at aderol lol
 Man like big p
 What even is that for
 For adhd kids to help em concentrate I think
 Yeah just like Ritalin
 I tried modaphonyl which is similar
 It's what students take to focus
 I've taken Ritalin
 Got bare focused lol
 And aderol they're both good for that
 Focused off my tits m8
 They will also weigh you in if you get waved too
 ðŸ˜‚
 America is mad though most people are reliant on some sort of prescription drugs
 My cousins there are all on various pills a day
 Itâ€™s fucked
 Yeah
 So are mums
 You know how much money they made off brands like activis and xanax
 Cause it's some obscene amount, and they're still making money off it and they're shut down
 That, is how to run a business
 Stormy actually gave me this pink and white thing for concentration
 Like a weaker Ritalin
 Was gonna bang it now but you need to bang it in the morning and it'll make you FFFFOOOOOOCCCCCCUUUUUSSSSSSS
 Elvanse?

 Filthy was doing a mad contract last week it's usually a walker thing
 Couldn't believe how easy and much it paid
 ðŸ˜‚
 Mad
 Just seen bubbles coming round elly roundabout
 Had to hide
 The walkers in NYC make mad money.

 This ain't mad money
 And they don't even pay for my travel card
 8 to 6
 Peak
 They're not paying for it?
 Cunts
 None of em have got a clue
 Billy you Walkin? That's mad
 Lol what are you actually walking bill?
 Explain
 My necks about to snap off lol
 I have literally no idea mate
 I'm just sitting with Lamar at the moment and he don't know either
 I thought sprint scrapped this Walkin ting.
Seems kinda pointless
 They better be paying you while you're sitting there
 Don't let em mug you off
 You got your bike?
 I'll get you back if you think you are

ðŸðŸ‘ŠðŸ
 Much love my brother enjoy
 Safe man
 Anyone have a micro scooter?
 Thinking I could tailwhip my way through this walking week
 Hop bars all over the curb
 Why you walking zimmy?
 I did it for a day here because my knee was fucked and I wanted to work. And itâ€™s a thing here.
 The core is dense as fuck, easier to do it on foot than on bike sometimes.
 Jay said he needed someone so gave it a go mane
 Whatâ€™s going on with this walking thing ? Iâ€™m baffed
 Boring but easy
 Foot couriers ? Lolol
 Theyâ€™ve existed in North America for decades
 Yeah I'm walking about doing dockets for a 80 quid guarantee man
 Damn
 Like doing work on the island but more buildings closer together.
 Thatâ€™s not bad
 Easy
 It's pretty peak that they don't give me travel expenses though
 I walked 8 miles today and was like fuck this
 Maxed out the oyster
 so Â£72 a day
 or is the maxing out not Â£8?
 Yeah capped
 I don't know how much the cap is though
 At least youâ€™re guaranteed to not get any punctures eh.
 â€¢_â€¢
 I ain't had one for time! Maybe even since you left Alex
 Why can't u do it on a bike billy
 No need to tell anyone
 Yh thatâ€™s what I was thinking
 Why do foot couriers even exist
 Or get one of them little scooters like the city bods ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Or roller blades
 Fruit boots and zoots
 Perfect. Start a movement
 Side surf up to the loading bay like what up lolol
 Bill can we change your callsign to Zim Zimmerframe
 but, if you turned up 5 days 8-6 on a bike to get Â£80, why not just turn up for less hours on the pushbike circuit and make more money?
 this scam doesnâ€™t seem worthwhile
 Sounds simple
 But our guy wouldn't take the job if it was a pay cut, I think
 i guess
 itâ€™s not even the money so much as the turning up to work i canâ€™t compute
 Marching around the city sounds pretty fun to be honest
 Different work kit options + styles
 Heavy walking boots or vibram 5 fingers
 Zimmerframe
 Mental
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 I got them trail runners on for max grip

 Most vegan bullshit places
 Vx on cally
 Is it a big vegan thing??
 itâ€™s an alternative refreshment that isnâ€™t made by the evil people at coca-cola
 Tru tru
 Don't think it's vegan
 It's like the trendy edge drink init
 Seeeeeeeen
 Well one straight edge run coffee shop stocks it
 And they make a big deal about it
 I've never had it
 But heard it's banging hahah
 Itâ€™s like a malty lucozade thing
 It does bang tho
 Solid hangover cure lol
 Malty? Nice
 Yeah kinda
 Idk Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s a better word to describe it but yeah
 MatÃ© is like a South American tea thing, so probably like a fizzy that.
 How can the Stansted express cost Â£17 one way? This country.
 Mate it's steep init
 Lols
 Ridiculous
 Went to CPH for 18Â£ return
 How can they justify that? It's fucking shit and slow.
 stansted is pretty far away
 thatâ€™s my guess
 Getting there another way is absolutely atrocious though. Just gotta bite your tongue and pay it I think
 Yeah, even driving it's mental costs
 Parkings stupid money and the drop off rules are mad
 You're allowed like less than 10 mins if you go over that you get charged a score
 Not even allowed to drive on the runway ffs
 this country
 What happened to the days of spitfires and clear class hierarchies
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 I have no idea whoâ€™s genuinely working class now
 Mad ting
 I thinks it's people from Shadwell or northerners
 Hahahaha fucksake
 For the most part
 Shadwell is fucking shit tho
 Oi don't go dissing shadwell mate
 Yeah donâ€™t diss the ends
 he doesnâ€™t understand
 he drinks at the gowlett
 Hahaha Sandwell is the only place left with the old London charm
 That market is something from the 50/60s
 Even old parts of Mayfair are ruined my Thai kids in vetements
 Where's Sandwell?
 Shadwell has 0% London charm
 Calling it working class ain't a diss. Comparing it to the north is tho
 Haven't you been to Poplar?
 Hell
 Awful
 Canning Town
 Now that's a real shit hole
 they are all great
 these people canâ€™t handle the gritty real ness
 too busy sipping over priced coffee in some poncy cafe where poundstretcher used to be
 Canning Town in my mind is the end of the world
 It's like the north wall in game of thrones
 Everything after it is gash
 It's these out of towners talking bout how they love the ghetto then cry to the old bill and their parents when they get beat up and robbed
 working class =/= underclass.
 For the record I'm one of the only cunts in this chat from London
 Me Jamie and jay holding it
 Jake Putney don't count
 Init
 Fuck off back to Norfolk
 They will probably declare independence soon and join Switzerland

 Attendance has dropped year by year
 Lol peak
 Haha
 This walking shit is so fucking tiring
 Can you let me get On a bus or something
 All city work
 Peak
 what do you mean "let" you
 Just get on the bus Bruv
 What's the point if it's city to city shit man
 I would just do it on my bike
 You don't make a easy 80 doing city locals all day
 Unless your huggy
 Mate. I'd love to do city work all day. Easy money.
 What walking
 No, on my bike ofcourse.
 Imagine being Lindsey all day but doing way more work, obviously.
 If the work was there also
 City is boring as fuck
 Tru tru
 Get a micro scooter fam
 Or some heelys

 Do the whole thing dressed as a Teletubbie carrying a bucket and see if you can raise some money for "disabled children"
 London Courier Scooter Alliance
 Hahaha tom
 There was a courier systems guy that had a micro scooter
 Wait there's a crusty old Italian man in the airport with a 'yes fam!' beanie on.. how will I get a photo??
 Years back he did all the stuff out of cibt when they were Victoria going to the island
 No joke
 Would see him sometimes get out of bank station
 Fuck that for a laugh
   will remember this dude he used to come wood street sometimes
 Bang bang

 Oh nah loooool

 This app is the end of city sprint trust
 My phone usually lasts the whole day and it was out by 3
 My portable charger can hardly keep up. We're DOOMED
 Indeed
 The app sucks baawwlllzz
 Lame
 They make you use your own phone? Jesus. I blame that dog in the lab coat. Nothing like cost cutting like that to upset the workforce
 Yeah mate it's terrible. And still have to pay the same charge to use it when it officially comes out according to papa Michael
 Rip the beautiful mc67
 With an incredibly brilliant interface
 Fuck still have to pay the same??
 No way
 Yep
 No you don't
 I told you earlier
 If you on the app
 No charge
 Nah for the minute there is no charge
 But there will be a charge
 From the papa himself
 He's Stalin that guy
 No way
 He can't
 Gotta pay the developers so how
 And he won't
 Subsidise my phone bill then
 After all this waiting at home for the tv internet the cunt posted it
 U caaaaaants
 Lmao
 Set it up and it won't even start until tomorrow when our plan starts
 Fuck my life
 Got holiday next week aswell could of done with that p
 Waaaah
 Jay lets challenge his morals together
 Fight the evil within city sprint
 Love will win
 Start putting brothers on 1k garras
 Did someone say pelican for a red stripe?
 Yeah
 I'm down for that t
 Woi oi
 V possible
 Got a run going black friars
 There's a Black friars going Camden waiting for you Jake
 Haha
 (Pete and jay playing god)
 Queue Jake's bike braking.
 I just tell u straight naw son
 ðŸ˜‚

 Seamus
 Lol
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Stop listening to the radio
 I never do any way
 Me neither
     send me a DM if you swing by, I just got back
 Well I'm gonna get the 12 home soon anyway
 And I owe Jake 30 bones
 So why don't you dm me?
 Bill you alright?
 No
 There in 3  
 There now
 Someoneâ€™s here smoking really bad mersh
 Come on in
 Woah speedy alright 2mins
 If only he was speedy during the day ðŸ˜”
 Shut it
 Even walking, Billy done more jobs than the circuit facist
 ðŸ˜’
 Fuck
 Go on billy
 Damn this new Louie Theroux is deep
 Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
 And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
 Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
 I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
 I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
 To do them little ones
 Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
 Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
 Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
   could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
 He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
 Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
 Nah
 Still would stay on a bike most likely
 If it rains can't skate
 If only segways weren't banned
 Slippery when wet
 How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
 But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
 Unless those big ones
 ðŸ˜‚
 ðŸ¤”
 Because C's doesn't believe in future
 You still on e bullit?
 No
 Haven't worked for 2 weeks
 Might ask to go on walker circuit with the omnium
   do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
 And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
 Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
 Stops at all major clients
 So basically a dedicated van
 Or a single bullit
 ðŸ˜‚
 Lol yh
 Hahha helper dockets
 Chris ask for helper dockets when giving a lift to fellow walkers
 Now that's a banger
 15 an hour
 Berwins to broadgate all day
 ðŸ˜‚
 ðŸ‘†
 It's just Push bike but on foot
 I'm off it now it was shit
 Anybody know a couple looking for somewhere to live?
 Didn't know u were into that archie
 Walkers are the new fixie. Get over yourselves. All of you are replaceable!!
 They got these new whatever call cargo bikes
 Excel kids moving in.
 Fuck it. It's a open market kids. 5 days or nothing.

 How much are u willing to give ðŸ¤”
 Anything not to fucking live south.

 My phone usually lasts the whole day and it was out by 3
 My portable charger can hardly keep up. We're DOOMED
 Indeed
 The app sucks baawwlllzz
 Lame
 They make you use your own phone? Jesus. I blame that dog in the lab coat. Nothing like cost cutting like that to upset the workforce
 Yeah mate it's terrible. And still have to pay the same charge to use it when it officially comes out according to papa Michael
 Rip the beautiful mc67
 With an incredibly brilliant interface
 Fuck still have to pay the same??
 No way
 Yep
 No you don't
 I told you earlier
 If you on the app
 No charge
 Nah for the minute there is no charge
 But there will be a charge
 From the papa himself
 He's Stalin that guy
 No way
 He can't
 Gotta pay the developers so how
 And he won't
 Subsidise my phone bill then
 After all this waiting at home for the tv internet the cunt posted it
 U caaaaaants
 Lmao
 Set it up and it won't even start until tomorrow when our plan starts
 Fuck my life
 Got holiday next week aswell could of done with that p
 Waaaah
 Jay lets challenge his morals together

 Shut it
 Even walking, Billy done more jobs than the circuit facist
 ðŸ˜’
 Fuck
 Go on billy
 Damn this new Louie Theroux is deep
 Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
 And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
 Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
 I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
 I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
 To do them little ones
 Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
 Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
 Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
   could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
 He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
 Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
 Nah
 Still would stay on a bike most likely
 If it rains can't skate
 If only segways weren't banned
 Slippery when wet
 How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
 But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
 Unless those big ones
 ðŸ˜‚
 ðŸ¤”
 Because C's doesn't believe in future
 You still on e bullit?
 No
 Haven't worked for 2 weeks
 Might ask to go on walker circuit with the omnium
   do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
 And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
 Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
 Stops at all major clients
 So basically a dedicated van
 Or a single bullit

 Lol yh

 Can you let me get On a bus or something
 All city work
 Peak

 Just get on the bus Bruv
 What's the point if it's city to city shit man
 I would just do it on my bike
 You don't make a easy 80 doing city locals all day
 Unless your huggy
 Mate. I'd love to do city work all day. Easy money.
 What walking
 No, on my bike ofcourse.
 Imagine being Lindsey all day but doing way more work, obviously.
 If the work was there also
 City is boring as fuck
 Tru tru

 There was a courier systems guy that had a micro scooter
 Wait there's a crusty old Italian man in the airport with a 'yes fam!' beanie on.. how will I get a photo??

 This app is the end of city sprint trust
 My phone usually lasts the whole day and it was out by 3
 My portable charger can hardly keep up. We're DOOMED
 Indeed
 The app sucks baawwlllzz
 Lame
 They make you use your own phone? Jesus. I blame that dog in the lab coat. Nothing like cost cutting like that to upset the workforce
 Yeah mate it's terrible. And still have to pay the same charge to use it when it officially comes out according to papa Michael
 Rip the beautiful mc67
 With an incredibly brilliant interface
 Fuck still have to pay the same??
 No way
 Yep
 No you don't
 I told you earlier
 If you on the app
 No charge
 Nah for the minute there is no charge
 But there will be a charge
 From the papa himself
 He's Stalin that guy
 No way
 He can't
 Gotta pay the developers so how
 And he won't
 Subsidise my phone bill then
 After all this waiting at home for the tv internet the cunt posted it
 U caaaaaants
 Lmao
 Set it up and it won't even start until tomorrow when our plan starts
 Fuck my life
 Got holiday next week aswell could of done with that p
 Waaaah
 Jay lets challenge his morals together
 Fight the evil within city sprint
 Love will win
 Start putting brothers on 1k garras
 Did someone say pelican for a red stripe?
 Yeah
 I'm down for that t
 Woi oi
 V possible
 Got a run going black friars
 There's a Black friars going Camden waiting for you Jake

 Lol
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Stop listening to the radio
 I never do any way
 Me neither
     send me a DM if you swing by, I just got back
 Well I'm gonna get the 12 home soon anyway
 And I owe Jake 30 bones
 So why don't you dm me?
 Bill you alright?
 No
 There in 3  
 There now
 Someoneâ€™s here smoking really bad mersh
 Come on in
 Woah speedy alright 2mins
 If only he was speedy during the day ðŸ˜”
 Shut it
 Even walking, Billy done more jobs than the circuit facist
 ðŸ˜’
 Fuck
 Go on billy
 Damn this new Louie Theroux is deep
 Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
 And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
 Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
 I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
 I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
 To do them little ones
 Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
 Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
 Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
   could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
 He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
 Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
 Nah
 Still would stay on a bike most likely
 If it rains can't skate
 If only segways weren't banned
 Slippery when wet
 How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
 But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
 Unless those big ones
 ðŸ˜‚
 ðŸ¤”
 Because C's doesn't believe in future
 You still on e bullit?
 No
 Haven't worked for 2 weeks
 Might ask to go on walker circuit with the omnium
   do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
 And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
 Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
 Stops at all major clients
 So basically a dedicated van
 Or a single bullit
 ðŸ˜‚
 Lol yh
 Hahha helper dockets
 Chris ask for helper dockets when giving a lift to fellow walkers
 Now that's a banger
 15 an hour
 Berwins to broadgate all day
 ðŸ˜‚
 ðŸ‘†
 It's just Push bike but on foot
 I'm off it now it was shit
 Anybody know a couple looking for somewhere to live?
 Didn't know u were into that archie
 Walkers are the new fixie. Get over yourselves. All of you are replaceable!!
 They got these new whatever call cargo bikes
 Excel kids moving in.
 Fuck it. It's a open market kids. 5 days or nothing.
 ðŸ˜‚
   how much.
 How much are u willing to give ðŸ¤”
 Anything not to fucking live south.

 Are there any sporting fixtures on the weekend that means we could have house beers and get ignorant?
 Lmao
 Picked the right day for it
 Yeh boy haha
 Ain't going to lie I laughed when I realised
 Still good days to work are the wet ones
 Thought I'm sitting in a house with nothing to do as there no tv or internet
 It's pretty boring
 Moto gp
 Rub one out
 pornhub.wap
 Also today is strangely quiet it seems
 Would rather be at home rubbing one out too tbh
 Babestation if you got tv
 On demand sexetera
 All them walkers started running

 Attendance has dropped year by year
 Lol peak
 Haha
 This walking shit is so fucking tiring
 Can you let me get On a bus or something
 All city work
 Peak
 what do you mean "let" you
 Just get on the bus Bruv
 What's the point if it's city to city shit man
 I would just do it on my bike
 You don't make a easy 80 doing city locals all day
 Unless your huggy
 Mate. I'd love to do city work all day. Easy money.
 What walking
 No, on my bike ofcourse.
 Imagine being Lindsey all day but doing way more work, obviously.
 If the work was there also
 City is boring as fuck
 Tru tru
 Get a micro scooter fam
 Or some heelys

 London Courier Scooter Alliance
 Hahaha tom
 There was a courier systems guy that had a micro scooter
 Wait there's a crusty old Italian man in the airport with a 'yes fam!' beanie on.. how will I get a photo??
 Years back he did all the stuff out of cibt when they were Victoria going to the island
 No joke
 Would see him sometimes get out of bank station
 Fuck that for a laugh

 Bang bang

 This app is the end of city sprint trust
 My phone usually lasts the whole day and it was out by 3
 My portable charger can hardly keep up. We're DOOMED
 Indeed
 The app sucks baawwlllzz
 Lame
 They make you use your own phone? Jesus. I blame that dog in the lab coat. Nothing like cost cutting like that to upset the workforce
 Yeah mate it's terrible. And still have to pay the same charge to use it when it officially comes out according to papa Michael
 Rip the beautiful mc67
 With an incredibly brilliant interface
 Fuck still have to pay the same??
 No way
 Yep
 No you don't
 I told you earlier
 If you on the app
 No charge
 Nah for the minute there is no charge
 But there will be a charge
 From the papa himself
 He's Stalin that guy
 No way
 He can't
 Gotta pay the developers so how
 And he won't
 Subsidise my phone bill then
 After all this waiting at home for the tv internet the cunt posted it
 U caaaaaants
 Lmao
 Set it up and it won't even start until tomorrow when our plan starts
 Fuck my life
 Got holiday next week aswell could of done with that p
 Waaaah
 Jay lets challenge his morals together
 Fight the evil within city sprint
 Love will win
 Start putting brothers on 1k garras
 Did someone say pelican for a red stripe?
 Yeah
 I'm down for that t
 Woi oi
 V possible
 Got a run going black friars
 There's a Black friars going Camden waiting for you Jake
 Haha
 (Pete and jay playing god)
 Queue Jake's bike braking.
 I just tell u straight naw son
 ðŸ˜‚
 Give it to sea Mia
 Seamus
 Lol
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Stop listening to the radio
 I never do any way
 Me neither
     send me a DM if you swing by, I just got back
 Well I'm gonna get the 12 home soon anyway
 And I owe Jake 30 bones
 So why don't you dm me?
 Bill you alright?
 No
 There in 3  
 There now
 Someoneâ€™s here smoking really bad mersh
 Come on in
 Woah speedy alright 2mins
 If only he was speedy during the day ðŸ˜”
 Shut it
 Even walking, Billy done more jobs than the circuit facist
 ðŸ˜’
 Fuck
 Go on billy
 Damn this new Louie Theroux is deep
 Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
 And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
 Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
 I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
 I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
 To do them little ones
 Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
 Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
 Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
   could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
 He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
 Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
 Nah
 Still would stay on a bike most likely
 If it rains can't skate
 If only segways weren't banned
 Slippery when wet
 How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
 But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
 Unless those big ones
 ðŸ˜‚
 ðŸ¤”
 Because C's doesn't believe in future
 You still on e bullit?
 No
 Haven't worked for 2 weeks
 Might ask to go on walker circuit with the omnium
   do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
 And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
 Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
 Stops at all major clients
 So basically a dedicated van
 Or a single bullit
 ðŸ˜‚
 Lol yh
 Hahha helper dockets
 Chris ask for helper dockets when giving a lift to fellow walkers
 Now that's a banger
 15 an hour
 Berwins to broadgate all day
 ðŸ˜‚
 ðŸ‘†
 It's just Push bike but on foot
 I'm off it now it was shit
 Anybody know a couple looking for somewhere to live?
 Didn't know u were into that archie
 Walkers are the new fixie. Get over yourselves. All of you are replaceable!!
 They got these new whatever call cargo bikes
 Excel kids moving in.
 Fuck it. It's a open market kids. 5 days or nothing.

 If itâ€™s still there next week Iâ€™ll have it

 everything i own is currently on ebay/the forums
 just need someone to take the bait

 He's now known as Clym Ellis's mate
 Hahahahahaha
 Yeah was bare awkward man
 He even crashed into the back of me while following me around
 "I heard Tim the infamous is powered off of cocaine alone"
 Iâ€™ve never seen or met Clym
 His name rhymes with grim thatâ€™s peak
 mf clym
 ðŸ‘Œ
 Real talk is it true
 He can follow me at work and pay for the nose beers on Friday
 Sounds good

 Some picture appeared online of some airsofter in a MOD base, blurred faces, holding an SS flag... All hell broke loose in the airsoft Facebook world, hundreds of people defending them saying SS stands for scout sniper and it's an old American thing, no Nazi connotations .....
 ...then a friend found this image..
 <Media omitted>
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Yeaaaaaah
 Theyâ€™re nazis
 Fuckkk
 Unblurred faces and Hitler salutes. He posted the picture and said, is this ScoutSniper?
 All kicked off
 Then this cunt messaged my mate saying "I'll give you money, please take this picture down" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ™„
 So as I said, I'm just picking on kids on the wonderful world of the internet.
 Take the money and out him anyway
 My mate works for the mail
 Get a pay out and ruin a life ðŸ¤·â€
â™‚
 That's what I said, my friend took it down, because he's not a cunt.
 So I posted it, hoping for a pay out.
 Cash4nazis.co.uk
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Hahaha fuck
 Iâ€™ll post it for the pay out
 Anyone see that vice thing about war reenactments and it's nazis
 Pretty funny

 Sorry, ahem... Gemma from TOWIE?

 DW I got your scrubby self
 Thank you
 <Media omitted>
 halp
 That bike looks nice and illegal
 â€œI felt unsafeâ€
 for real
 since when have they had speed bumps in the park?
 Since we became the only place in the world that it's deemed acceptable to wear full lycra to ride to work
 Which I assume is exactly what you're doing, Sam
 Full regents park rouleurs kit, s works aero helmet and pink rapha shoes
 the helmet hasnâ€™t arrived yet
 but yes
 speaking of commuting
 for some reason i want one of those van moof bikes
 the ones that look like they are made from scaffolding
 The zsa zsa special
 but you canâ€™t buy the pedal back brake version anymore
 yeah exactly
 i rate them
 I love them
 iâ€™ve been keeping an eye out but havenâ€™t found one for sale yet
 the new ones have disk breaks and donâ€™t seem as chill
 https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F263274145027
 that looks great
 Theyâ€™re steezed out
 Really, no pedal back? Hmm. You could probably get a pedal back nexus hub on your iribe if you wanted to try and outdo Tim for kool fixie bike reattribution
 I wonder if theyâ€™re nice to work on
 They kinda look like tanks
 reallllly?
 But alu frame
 this is tempting
 <Media omitted>
 gemma?
 STOP EVERYTHING YOURE DOING.. THE BEST VIDEO IN THE WORLD IS BACK ON YOUTUBE
 https://youtu.be/4wILoM4lMJE
 Omg
 The build up was good but he didn't even film the burst through the ceiling properly
 Is this worth the data?
 Yeah why not
 Better than Sam riding through the park
 At least I know Jake will love it. I've been waiting for the return of that video for literally like 8 years haha
 ðŸ˜¢
 Sorry sam
 I too hate those speed bumps. What's worse is they're vicious cycle specific ones
 "Marvin's ruined the party"
 "ILL PAY FA DE RUUF"
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Gutted they didn't get him coming through the ruuf
 Innit
 Hahaha
 I mean they kinda do, but probably the guy filming it doesn't actually believe Marvin is gonna go through with it. Also, blantant disregard for the woman's condition after the fact. Probably still lying there 12 years on
 Ruuf>woman
 Yh she coulda broken her hip
 I did a photo shoot for van moof in a Paul smith suit for tank magazine once
 No lie

 No one is selling crack, guv.. they just keep smoking it all!
 C'mon Tom mate let us feel wanted

 Mental
 I guess this is really what it's like to be a courier
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 My dream lasted awhile
 Maybe not overdraft but keiran levels off broke on a Tuesday type talk
 Bless him
 Anyway I'm thinking out loud

 NYC crew are clever as fuck
 Unreal hustle
 Nah rate that
 We should get on an inner city coke hustle
 Mate I mean bikes always do stuff faster god knows the maths to it but riders in NYC make 500 a day on busy days
 It's a silly hustle
 Most riders outside of main company so 3 shifts a week
 1000-1500 on top of earnings all smartly done
 Pretty crazy hustle
 But risk of getting jumped etc
 Tim didn't you become a dealer 6 months ago?
 Word these people are running it
 Mad dynamics in America with that shit
 Or NYC especially
 Even f you're just butning a loud one from what I hear
 You crackas would be brilliant

 Mate. I'd love to do city work all day. Easy money.

 Imagine being Lindsey all day but doing way more work, obviously.

 This app is the end of city sprint trust
 My phone usually lasts the whole day and it was out by 3
 My portable charger can hardly keep up. We're DOOMED
 Indeed
 The app sucks baawwlllzz
 Lame
 They make you use your own phone? Jesus. I blame that dog in the lab coat. Nothing like cost cutting like that to upset the workforce
 Yeah mate it's terrible. And still have to pay the same charge to use it when it officially comes out according to papa Michael
 Rip the beautiful mc67
 With an incredibly brilliant interface
 Fuck still have to pay the same??
 No way
 Yep
 No you don't
 I told you earlier
 If you on the app
 No charge
 Nah for the minute there is no charge
 But there will be a charge
 From the papa himself
 He's Stalin that guy
 No way
 He can't
 Gotta pay the developers so how
 And he won't
 Subsidise my phone bill then
 After all this waiting at home for the tv internet the cunt posted it
 U caaaaaants
 Lmao
 Set it up and it won't even start until tomorrow when our plan starts
 Fuck my life
 Got holiday next week aswell could of done with that p
 Waaaah
 Jay lets challenge his morals together
 Fight the evil within city sprint
 Love will win

 No

 Someoneâ€™s here smoking really bad mersh
 Come on in
 Woah speedy alright 2mins
 If only he was speedy during the day ðŸ˜”
 Shut it
 Even walking, Billy done more jobs than the circuit facist
 ðŸ˜’
 Fuck
 Go on billy
 Damn this new Louie Theroux is deep
 Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
 And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
 Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
 I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
 I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
 To do them little ones
 Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
 Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
 Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
   could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
 He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
 Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
 Nah
 Still would stay on a bike most likely
 If it rains can't skate
 If only segways weren't banned
 Slippery when wet
 How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
 But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
 Unless those big ones
 ðŸ˜‚
 ðŸ¤”
 Because C's doesn't believe in future
 You still on e bullit?
 No
 Haven't worked for 2 weeks
 Might ask to go on walker circuit with the omnium
   do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
 And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
 Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
 Stops at all major clients
 So basically a dedicated van
 Or a single bullit
 ðŸ˜‚
 Lol yh
 Hahha helper dockets
 Chris ask for helper dockets when giving a lift to fellow walkers
 Now that's a banger

 They make you use your own phone? Jesus. I blame that dog in the lab coat. Nothing like cost cutting like that to upset the workforce
 Yeah mate it's terrible. And still have to pay the same charge to use it when it officially comes out according to papa Michael
 Rip the beautiful mc67
 With an incredibly brilliant interface
 Fuck still have to pay the same??
 No way
 Yep
 No you don't
 I told you earlier
 If you on the app
 No charge
 Nah for the minute there is no charge
 But there will be a charge
 From the papa himself
 He's Stalin that guy
 No way
 He can't
 Gotta pay the developers so how
 And he won't
 Subsidise my phone bill then
 After all this waiting at home for the tv internet the cunt posted it
 U caaaaaants
 Lmao
 Set it up and it won't even start until tomorrow when our plan starts
 Fuck my life
 Got holiday next week aswell could of done with that p
 Waaaah
 Jay lets challenge his morals together
 Fight the evil within city sprint
 Love will win
 Start putting brothers on 1k garras
 Did someone say pelican for a red stripe?
 Yeah
 I'm down for that t
 Woi oi
 V possible
 Got a run going black friars
 There's a Black friars going Camden waiting for you Jake
 Haha
 (Pete and jay playing god)
 Queue Jake's bike braking.

 And I owe Jake 30 bones
 So why don't you dm me?
 Bill you alright?
 No
 There in 3  
 There now
 Someoneâ€™s here smoking really bad mersh
 Come on in
 Woah speedy alright 2mins
 If only he was speedy during the day ðŸ˜”
 Shut it
 Even walking, Billy done more jobs than the circuit facist
 ðŸ˜’
 Fuck
 Go on billy
 Damn this new Louie Theroux is deep
 Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
 And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
 Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
 I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
 I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
 To do them little ones
 Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
 Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
 Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
   could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
 He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
 Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
 Nah
 Still would stay on a bike most likely
 If it rains can't skate
 If only segways weren't banned
 Slippery when wet
 How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
 But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
 Unless those big ones
 ðŸ˜‚
 ðŸ¤”
 Because C's doesn't believe in future
 You still on e bullit?
 No
 Haven't worked for 2 weeks
 Might ask to go on walker circuit with the omnium
   do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
 And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
 Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
 Stops at all major clients
 So basically a dedicated van
 Or a single bullit
 ðŸ˜‚
 Lol yh
 Hahha helper dockets
 Chris ask for helper dockets when giving a lift to fellow walkers
 Now that's a banger

 Just get on the bus Bruv
 What's the point if it's city to city shit man
 I would just do it on my bike
 You don't make a easy 80 doing city locals all day
 Unless your huggy
 Mate. I'd love to do city work all day. Easy money.
 What walking
 No, on my bike ofcourse.
 Imagine being Lindsey all day but doing way more work, obviously.
 If the work was there also
 City is boring as fuck

 This app is the end of city sprint trust
 My phone usually lasts the whole day and it was out by 3
 My portable charger can hardly keep up. We're DOOMED
 Indeed
 The app sucks baawwlllzz
 Lame
 They make you use your own phone? Jesus. I blame that dog in the lab coat. Nothing like cost cutting like that to upset the workforce
 Yeah mate it's terrible. And still have to pay the same charge to use it when it officially comes out according to papa Michael
 Rip the beautiful mc67
 With an incredibly brilliant interface
 Fuck still have to pay the same??
 No way
 Yep
 No you don't
 I told you earlier
 If you on the app
 No charge
 Nah for the minute there is no charge
 But there will be a charge
 From the papa himself
 He's Stalin that guy
 No way
 He can't
 Gotta pay the developers so how
 And he won't
 Subsidise my phone bill then
 After all this waiting at home for the tv internet the cunt posted it
 U caaaaaants
 Lmao
 Set it up and it won't even start until tomorrow when our plan starts
 Fuck my life
 Got holiday next week aswell could of done with that p
 Waaaah
 Jay lets challenge his morals together

 So why don't you dm me?
 Bill you alright?
 No
 There in 3  
 There now
 Someoneâ€™s here smoking really bad mersh
 Come on in
 Woah speedy alright 2mins
 If only he was speedy during the day ðŸ˜”
 Shut it
 Even walking, Billy done more jobs than the circuit facist
 ðŸ˜’
 Fuck
 Go on billy
 Damn this new Louie Theroux is deep
 Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
 And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
 Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
 I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
 I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
 To do them little ones
 Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
 Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
 Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
   could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
 He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
 Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
 Nah
 Still would stay on a bike most likely
 If it rains can't skate
 If only segways weren't banned
 Slippery when wet
 How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
 But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
 Unless those big ones
 ðŸ˜‚
 ðŸ¤”
 Because C's doesn't believe in future
 You still on e bullit?
 No
 Haven't worked for 2 weeks
 Might ask to go on walker circuit with the omnium
   do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
 And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
 Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
 Stops at all major clients
 So basically a dedicated van
 Or a single bullit
 ðŸ˜‚
 Lol yh
 Hahha helper dockets
 Chris ask for helper dockets when giving a lift to fellow walkers
 Now that's a banger
 15 an hour
 Berwins to broadgate all day

 I'm off it now it was shit
 Anybody know a couple looking for somewhere to live?

 it needs to be rattle canned and left to rot outside the boat
 ðŸ‘Œ
 Ahem
 If itâ€™s still there next week Iâ€™ll have it
 ðŸ˜‚
 everything i own is currently on ebay/the forums
 just need someone to take the bait
 iâ€™m not that fussed though
 my desire for gears is correlated with where the boat is moored
 i desire w2 levels of gear right now
 You back there then?
 yeah just next to harrow road
 Nice
 More practical
 yeah.
 tbh itâ€™s nicer to be far out
 but trains are pricey and long
 for the past two weeks weâ€™ve been moored next to up and coming willesden junction. the local shop sold fourpure/beavertown etc
 i was in my white boy element
 Lmao I Willesden really getting like thatâ€™s

 The beavertown brewery is a nice thing to do when your back east is worth a visit
 Do a 6 pack can deal
 Try most of the drinks
 I don't think I've ruined it? It's so badly painted that the wind practically peels it off. Besides that it's fine (needs a new headset)

 Jay must know heâ€™s rocking a sprint bag there
 I questioned that in the CrackChat
 Clym
 Who
 Is he on sprint?
 Clym McKenzie
 Was causing shit on Lcef FB page a while ago
 He ain't even a courier man
 Oh shit heâ€™s that guy that was piping up in the witch hunt group
 Theres was doubt about his existence on the which hunt group a while back
 Total beg
 Yeah
 Pedro gets me
 ðŸ˜‚
 Heâ€™s got a radio
 Kier was on and on about him
 Until they actually met
 Then he chilled i guess
 Heâ€™s lcsa
 Triple OG
 who are any of those people?
 Millennial messlifers
 Imagine begging a messenger how low is that
 Begging no future poor work ethic
 Only chance of owning a house is a floating one
 Is a scary world for us
 Spooky
 ðŸ˜‚
 Imagine
 How shit your life must be ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 That guy with the beard is abit off aswell
 Yeah heâ€™s next
 "I just wish society would hate me"
 Had some people back to mine yeah time we all went roof and he never left
 Like he left at like 7 literally I had to get into my pjs for him to get it
 "I wish even the security guards that come off a boat two weeks ago would look down on me"
 Yeah that guy
 What sort of fruit would plait his beard
 Macey was cussing him outside cannon st other week for joking about some terrorist thing
 Guys seems a douche
 And yeah beard thing is gross
 Yeah, when that thing happened in America, he was on WhatsApp saying, good, glad it wasn't me and shit like that.
 Little Connor went off at him
 Yeah that was it
 He was there too, screwing
 ðŸ˜‚
 He was crashing at pharaohs yard for a bit and had to leave the house every day but wasnâ€™t working so he would just lurk at loading bays
 ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
 Whats the guy in front trying to rest his elbow on
 I bumped into him at eversheds once and he literally followed me around for the rest of the day was so jarring
 What is in between the wheel and the handlebars
 Peak
 Then he tagged along to Crabtree and sat away from everyone on his own lol
 Think heâ€™s resting it on his dads knee
 Oh yh
   that is peak. Did he just have nothing else to do
 <Media omitted>
 Ayyyyy
 didnâ€™t he claim to have worked for 3d ?
 even though it was provably wrong
 It isn't hard to get a courier job though
 Why pretend?
 Alie
 Itâ€™s not a hard status to attain
 Init
 All u have to do is ask
 Kevs army
 What is the benefit of riding around all day pretending to work
 What if you get a puncture, then u are Â£5 down for that day
 Losing money
 Hahaha
 Hard
 Oh yeah that geezer with the beard came to crab asking for you
 For who?
 Tim?
 â€˜I want to meet London most famous courierâ€™
 That would kinda freak me out if he followed me about
 Nah Ellis
 ðŸ˜’ don't bring your mates to the house Ellis
 ðŸ˜‚
 He's now known as Clym Ellis's mate
 Hahahahahaha
 Yeah was bare awkward man
 He even crashed into the back of me while following me around
 "I heard Tim the infamous is powered off of cocaine alone"
 Iâ€™ve never seen or met Clym
 His name rhymes with grim thatâ€™s peak
 mf clym
 ðŸ‘Œ
 Real talk is it true
 He can follow me at work and pay for the nose beers on Friday
 Sounds good
 <Media omitted>

 Yeh nonce or a fed
 Some picture appeared online of some airsofter in a MOD base, blurred faces, holding an SS flag... All hell broke loose in the airsoft Facebook world, hundreds of people defending them saying SS stands for scout sniper and it's an old American thing, no Nazi connotations .....
 ...then a friend found this image..
 <Media omitted>
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Yeaaaaaah
 Theyâ€™re nazis
 Fuckkk
 Unblurred faces and Hitler salutes. He posted the picture and said, is this ScoutSniper?
 All kicked off
 Then this cunt messaged my mate saying "I'll give you money, please take this picture down" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ™„
 So as I said, I'm just picking on kids on the wonderful world of the internet.
 Take the money and out him anyway
 My mate works for the mail
 Get a pay out and ruin a life ðŸ¤·â€
â™‚
 That's what I said, my friend took it down, because he's not a cunt.
 So I posted it, hoping for a pay out.
 Cash4nazis.co.uk
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Hahaha fuck
 Iâ€™ll post it for the pay out
 Anyone see that vice thing about war reenactments and it's nazis
 Pretty funny

 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Hahahaha
 Sorry, ahem... Gemma from TOWIE?

 DW I got your scrubby self
 Thank you
 <Media omitted>
 halp
 That bike looks nice and illegal
 â€œI felt unsafeâ€
 for real
 since when have they had speed bumps in the park?
 Since we became the only place in the world that it's deemed acceptable to wear full lycra to ride to work
 Which I assume is exactly what you're doing, Sam
 Full regents park rouleurs kit, s works aero helmet and pink rapha shoes
 the helmet hasnâ€™t arrived yet
 but yes
 speaking of commuting
 for some reason i want one of those van moof bikes
 the ones that look like they are made from scaffolding
 The zsa zsa special
 but you canâ€™t buy the pedal back brake version anymore
 yeah exactly
 i rate them
 I love them
 iâ€™ve been keeping an eye out but havenâ€™t found one for sale yet
 the new ones have disk breaks and donâ€™t seem as chill
 https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F263274145027
 that looks great
 Theyâ€™re steezed out
 Really, no pedal back? Hmm. You could probably get a pedal back nexus hub on your iribe if you wanted to try and outdo Tim for kool fixie bike reattribution
 I wonder if theyâ€™re nice to work on
 They kinda look like tanks
 reallllly?
 But alu frame
 this is tempting
 <Media omitted>
 gemma?
 STOP EVERYTHING YOURE DOING.. THE BEST VIDEO IN THE WORLD IS BACK ON YOUTUBE
 https://youtu.be/4wILoM4lMJE
 Omg
 The build up was good but he didn't even film the burst through the ceiling properly
 Is this worth the data?
 Yeah why not
 Better than Sam riding through the park
 At least I know Jake will love it. I've been waiting for the return of that video for literally like 8 years haha
 ðŸ˜¢
 Sorry sam
 I too hate those speed bumps. What's worse is they're vicious cycle specific ones
 "Marvin's ruined the party"
 "ILL PAY FA DE RUUF"
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Gutted they didn't get him coming through the ruuf
 Innit
 Hahaha
 I mean they kinda do, but probably the guy filming it doesn't actually believe Marvin is gonna go through with it. Also, blantant disregard for the woman's condition after the fact. Probably still lying there 12 years on
 Ruuf>woman
 Yh she coulda broken her hip
 I did a photo shoot for van moof in a Paul smith suit for tank magazine once
 No lie

 @citysprint â€˜got da flake????â€™
 Iâ€™m still at elly pret, not even a Bloomberg in sight
 The roads were suuuuuper dead this morning
 Mad ting
 We stopped giving bloomys out until later
 Ah
 After 10 at least
 Makes sense
 Tbf the way itâ€™s looking Iâ€™ll probably still be here so ðŸ¤·â€
â™‚
   you in today?
 Iâ€™m so lonely
 Good that Bloomberg morning situation is bollocks
 The whole bloomberg situation is bollocks
 Morning or not
 Yeh true
 The 3quid into the west end thing for a larger then top box does sometimes really wind me up
 It's shit
 Yup
 But like we always say
 We are fodder
 If it wasn't such a big account id definitely encourage boycotting it
 But when you got 11 standers SE1 in the morning
 It helps to disperse
 Yeah exactly
 11 starters se now?
 Fuck
 Itâ€™s not the best docket but you can make like a tenner v easily and it brings you into the work
 And Jesus
 Thatâ€™d explain it
 Been empty an hour
 Yeah Tim, it ain't me you and neems there at 8 anymore
 <Media omitted>
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Yess
 Fuck
 Bloomys as it happens
 That used to be the vibe hahaha if you were out before 8 all them more London pre books
 Ahh those early mornings and now ya boy can't even remember where Leather Lane
 Oi if you get to of the SG double run arounds but ones the ec4 leg and the other docket is the ec3 one you can't put waiting on both can you?
 At the Austin friars bit
 Yeah you can surely
 Austin friars then blackfriars one yeah?
 There two separate runs basically init so it makes sense right?
 Yeh and the Austin birchin lane one aswell
 Yeah don't see why you wouldn't!
 Yeah course
 I can just feel Kevin in Thailand shaking at the idea
 I hope this wasn't just to show off that you had a good docket haha
 No no
 I'm milking the fuck out of it though
 On a slow start like today
 ðŸ˜µðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Haha
 Woi honest hour here though there all fucked at deuche

 Still.. 90Â£ delivery. I coulda swooped in and been home by 10am
 Dun kno

 But my xda is playing up anytime I try to go to that manifest page, so my entire morning has been on paper
 Remind me again what I pay Â£20 a week for ðŸ˜’
 I'm off today, I still got a call from Citysprint though you did Mark me down yeah?
 Hahah who rang you?
 Kevin ain't in
 He's the only one who cares about riders not being in
 Though mind you no lie he was joking about me not comming in at Nigel's drinks but he also condoned the reasons for not common in and said at your age that's what you should be do doin g
 Mixed signals
 Kevin is actually probably a bit insane
 Wonder how many Thai hookers heâ€™s murdered so far
 Jake

 TBH, if I had a van full to the top with parcels, I'd lose my shit too
 My ocds would do me

 Mate chasing ghosts of the pasts is bs
 Own up to your mistake, try to learn from it and move on
 Waste of energy to regret smthng

 Namaste bitch
 Word
 I have learnt Armin, you're right I shall take that on board
 What was the issue so we can laugh about it for a minute
 Then help
 You know how this chat works
 ðŸ˜‚
 Respecting women
 Hmmm go on
 Did you say daaaaaaaamn out loud in front of a gyal?
 I've done that before
 By accident
 Was very ashamed
 I don't know
 It's a tricky one
 Plenty of girls talk shit about boys in the face as well
 Yeh all about just being mature I guess that's what this kind of thing boils down to
 Basically everyone is afraid of flirting with girls cause ain't pc
 Dunno man
 Daaamn ain't that bad
 ðŸ™„
 Just regret it, donâ€™t do it again and move on
 And donâ€™t tell ur missus
 Always tell your missus everything
 A partnership based on secrets and lies
 Ain't up to god's standards
 ðŸ˜‚
 What happenend though billy?
 Can't be nothing someone in here ain't done before
 Boys/young men make mistakes init
 Grope incident?
 Oh I ain't done that
 Unless it was consented
 But then they usually have the regret
 ðŸ˜‚
 I smacked some asses when younger
 But smiles back made it better I guess
 When I was growing up that was a norm
 Any word on Alfie?
 We was with him the other day he seemed pretty down to be fair
 We were with him last night. And Dylan was getting him absolutely wrecked.
 Damn yeh with his money ha
 Did he get on it again?
 Hmmmm
 Got a girl sectioned
 Had a noble street earlier and that was her last name so reminded me
 Lmao
 I mean if sheâ€™s nuts sheâ€™s nuts
 Sheâ€™s probably better for it
 If someone gets sectioned its most likely more than 1 problem
 Real shite
 Bill you prob made a favour
 If feel very bad about it will come out for a drink
 Just not south
 Well what did she do?
 Nah it was my fault she was a depressed badders when I met her and I fucked her over
 I've know a girl before to get sectioned and the way she got it was her own good
 Nah man life is life you know
 That's her mentality
 Suicide threats etc
 Sad as that is
 Would of been you or someone else
 When people are mentality ill there mentality I'll
 Look mate
 What happened to tim
 Wow... First and possibly last time this could ever happen: I just got asked to take my clothes off because they thought I was a stripogram hahah

 Hahaha banter is a laugh but we are mates here init
 Good to get down aswell as laugh at each other
 can i laugh at billy saying he got a girl sectioned or is it too soon? because itâ€™s pretty funny
 in an absurd way.
 iâ€™m not laughing at you bill
 Alfie got a bird sectioned and it was a mental 5 year thing
 Only if you can make a really good joke about it
 Like worth the pain / trauma
 Init Jake that Chris Clayton thing
 Was a madness
 Like maaaaad
 All topped with booze and drugs
 Oh my god
 Yeah fully
 I mean it was pretty fucked up
 And now a birds getting Alfie sent to bin

 Met these two at the same sorta time

 Nice 7 it's it's then
 rog
 Took advantage of a depressed girl and chose tishi in the end
 Terrible that I even got to choose
 I'm a cunt
 How did u take advantage bill?
 yeah i donâ€™t see that big of an issue here
 Girls do enjoy sex as well bill
 not the way i do it

 My man looks straight out of CID
 Caught a misconduct charge and had to befriend couriers
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 He's a tax man or something
 *waste
 Imagine if the police had enough man power left to spend time and money infiltrating a community where the only crime committed are those against oneself
 No one is selling crack, guv.. they just keep smoking it all!
 C'mon Tom mate let us feel wanted
 At least by someone
 Sorry. I'm so miserable at the moment, I don't even believe that messbettys exist

 So for the first time in years I'm going to work a 3 day week which will most likely still leave me in my overdraft the following
 Mental
 I guess this is really what it's like to be a courier
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 My dream lasted awhile
 Maybe not overdraft but keiran levels off broke on a Tuesday type talk
 Bless him
 Anyway I'm thinking out loud
 We all fodder
 Coz itâ€™s used by yuppies with no kids rather than bankers fucking off over half term
 Welcome to real life big boy

 Well, maybe not
 But Iâ€™m glad ur having fun
 Keeping it some want clever
 Believe it or not
 ðŸ˜‚
 NYC crew are clever as fuck
 Unreal hustle
 Nah rate that
 We should get on an inner city coke hustle
 Mate I mean bikes always do stuff faster god knows the maths to it but riders in NYC make 500 a day on busy days
 It's a silly hustle
 Most riders outside of main company so 3 shifts a week
 1000-1500 on top of earnings all smartly done
 Pretty crazy hustle
 But risk of getting jumped etc
 Tim didn't you become a dealer 6 months ago?
 Word these people are running it
 Mad dynamics in America with that shit
 Or NYC especially
 Even f you're just butning a loud one from what I hear
 You crackas would be brilliant
 I'd probably get 'randomly searched' at the airport as always, let's go

 Unless your huggy
 Mate. I'd love to do city work all day. Easy money.

 My phone usually lasts the whole day and it was out by 3
 My portable charger can hardly keep up. We're DOOMED
 Indeed
 The app sucks baawwlllzz
 Lame
 They make you use your own phone? Jesus. I blame that dog in the lab coat. Nothing like cost cutting like that to upset the workforce
 Yeah mate it's terrible. And still have to pay the same charge to use it when it officially comes out according to papa Michael
 Rip the beautiful mc67
 With an incredibly brilliant interface
 Fuck still have to pay the same??
 No way
 Yep
 No you don't
 I told you earlier
 If you on the app
 No charge
 Nah for the minute there is no charge
 But there will be a charge
 From the papa himself
 He's Stalin that guy
 No way
 He can't
 Gotta pay the developers so how
 And he won't
 Subsidise my phone bill then
 After all this waiting at home for the tv internet the cunt posted it
 U caaaaaants
 Lmao
 Set it up and it won't even start until tomorrow when our plan starts
 Fuck my life
 Got holiday next week aswell could of done with that p
 Waaaah
 Jay lets challenge his morals together
 Fight the evil within city sprint
 Love will win
 Start putting brothers on 1k garras
 Did someone say pelican for a red stripe?
 Yeah
 I'm down for that t
 Woi oi

 So why don't you dm me?
 Bill you alright?
 No
 There in 3

 Someoneâ€™s here smoking really bad mersh
 Come on in
 Woah speedy alright 2mins
 If only he was speedy during the day ðŸ˜”
 Shut it
 Even walking, Billy done more jobs than the circuit facist
 ðŸ˜’
 Fuck
 Go on billy
 Damn this new Louie Theroux is deep
 Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
 And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
 Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
 I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
 I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
 To do them little ones
 Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
 Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
 Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
   could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
 He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
 Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
 Nah
 Still would stay on a bike most likely
 If it rains can't skate
 If only segways weren't banned
 Slippery when wet
 How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
 But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
 Unless those big ones
 ðŸ˜‚
 ðŸ¤”
 Because C's doesn't believe in future
 You still on e bullit?
 No
 Haven't worked for 2 weeks
 Might ask to go on walker circuit with the omnium
   do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
 And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
 Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
 Stops at all major clients
 So basically a dedicated van
 Or a single bullit
 ðŸ˜‚
 Lol yh
 Hahha helper dockets
 Chris ask for helper dockets when giving a lift to fellow walkers
 Now that's a banger

 All city work

 Just get on the bus Bruv
 What's the point if it's city to city shit man
 I would just do it on my bike
 You don't make a easy 80 doing city locals all day
 Unless your huggy
 Mate. I'd love to do city work all day. Easy money.
 What walking
 No, on my bike ofcourse.
 Imagine being Lindsey all day but doing way more work, obviously.
 If the work was there also
 City is boring as fuck

 This app is the end of city sprint trust
 My phone usually lasts the whole day and it was out by 3
 My portable charger can hardly keep up. We're DOOMED
 Indeed
 The app sucks baawwlllzz
 Lame
 They make you use your own phone? Jesus. I blame that dog in the lab coat. Nothing like cost cutting like that to upset the workforce
 Yeah mate it's terrible. And still have to pay the same charge to use it when it officially comes out according to papa Michael
 Rip the beautiful mc67
 With an incredibly brilliant interface
 Fuck still have to pay the same??
 No way
 Yep
 No you don't
 I told you earlier
 If you on the app
 No charge
 Nah for the minute there is no charge
 But there will be a charge
 From the papa himself
 He's Stalin that guy
 No way
 He can't
 Gotta pay the developers so how
 And he won't
 Subsidise my phone bill then
 After all this waiting at home for the tv internet the cunt posted it
 U caaaaaants
 Lmao
 Set it up and it won't even start until tomorrow when our plan starts
 Fuck my life
 Got holiday next week aswell could of done with that p
 Waaaah
 Jay lets challenge his morals together
 Fight the evil within city sprint
 Love will win
 Start putting brothers on 1k garras
 Did someone say pelican for a red stripe?
 Yeah
 I'm down for that t
 Woi oi

 I never do any way
 Me neither
     send me a DM if you swing by, I just got back
 Well I'm gonna get the 12 home soon anyway
 And I owe Jake 30 bones
 So why don't you dm me?
 Bill you alright?
 No
 There in 3  
 There now
 Someoneâ€™s here smoking really bad mersh
 Come on in
 Woah speedy alright 2mins
 If only he was speedy during the day ðŸ˜”
 Shut it
 Even walking, Billy done more jobs than the circuit facist
 ðŸ˜’
 Fuck
 Go on billy
 Damn this new Louie Theroux is deep
 Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
 And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
 Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
 I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
 I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
 To do them little ones
 Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
 Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
 Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
   could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
 He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
 Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
 Nah
 Still would stay on a bike most likely
 If it rains can't skate
 If only segways weren't banned
 Slippery when wet
 How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
 But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
 Unless those big ones
 ðŸ˜‚
 ðŸ¤”
 Because C's doesn't believe in future
 You still on e bullit?
 No
 Haven't worked for 2 weeks
 Might ask to go on walker circuit with the omnium
   do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
 And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
 Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
 Stops at all major clients
 So basically a dedicated van
 Or a single bullit

 It's a bagaboo
 Custom for sprint
 You can go on foot, they just have to escort you
 I only know this coz I got a flat in the loading bay once
 Someone had a flat at the top and wanted to walk down they wouldn't let him and I dropped for him
 Are you saying you used to be a courier jay?
 Hahaha

 Are there any sporting fixtures on the weekend that means we could have house beers and get ignorant?
 Lmao
 Picked the right day for it
 Yeh boy haha
 Ain't going to lie I laughed when I realised
 Still good days to work are the wet ones
 Thought I'm sitting in a house with nothing to do as there no tv or internet
 It's pretty boring
 Moto gp
 Rub one out

 Also today is strangely quiet it seems
 Would rather be at home rubbing one out too tbh

 This walking shit is so fucking tiring
 Can you let me get On a bus or something
 All city work
 Peak
 what do you mean "let" you
 Just get on the bus Bruv
 What's the point if it's city to city shit man
 I would just do it on my bike
 You don't make a easy 80 doing city locals all day
 Unless your huggy
 Mate. I'd love to do city work all day. Easy money.
 What walking
 No, on my bike ofcourse.
 Imagine being Lindsey all day but doing way more work, obviously.
 If the work was there also
 City is boring as fuck
 Tru tru

 Hahaha tom
 There was a courier systems guy that had a micro scooter
 Wait there's a crusty old Italian man in the airport with a 'yes fam!' beanie on.. how will I get a photo??
 Years back he did all the stuff out of cibt when they were Victoria going to the island

 This app is the end of city sprint trust
 My phone usually lasts the whole day and it was out by 3
 My portable charger can hardly keep up. We're DOOMED
 Indeed
 The app sucks baawwlllzz
 Lame
 They make you use your own phone? Jesus. I blame that dog in the lab coat. Nothing like cost cutting like that to upset the workforce
 Yeah mate it's terrible. And still have to pay the same charge to use it when it officially comes out according to papa Michael
 Rip the beautiful mc67
 With an incredibly brilliant interface
 Fuck still have to pay the same??
 No way
 Yep
 No you don't
 I told you earlier
 If you on the app
 No charge
 Nah for the minute there is no charge
 But there will be a charge
 From the papa himself
 He's Stalin that guy
 No way
 He can't
 Gotta pay the developers so how
 And he won't
 Subsidise my phone bill then
 After all this waiting at home for the tv internet the cunt posted it
 U caaaaaants
 Lmao
 Set it up and it won't even start until tomorrow when our plan starts
 Fuck my life
 Got holiday next week aswell could of done with that p
 Waaaah
 Jay lets challenge his morals together
 Fight the evil within city sprint
 Love will win
 Start putting brothers on 1k garras
 Did someone say pelican for a red stripe?
 Yeah
 I'm down for that t
 Woi oi
 V possible
 Got a run going black friars
 There's a Black friars going Camden waiting for you Jake
 Haha
 (Pete and jay playing god)
 Queue Jake's bike braking.
 I just tell u straight naw son

 Seamus
 Lol
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Stop listening to the radio
 I never do any way
 Me neither
     send me a DM if you swing by, I just got back
 Well I'm gonna get the 12 home soon anyway
 And I owe Jake 30 bones
 So why don't you dm me?
 Bill you alright?
 No
 There in 3  
 There now
 Someoneâ€™s here smoking really bad mersh
 Come on in
 Woah speedy alright 2mins
 If only he was speedy during the day ðŸ˜”
 Shut it
 Even walking, Billy done more jobs than the circuit facist
 ðŸ˜’
 Fuck
 Go on billy
 Damn this new Louie Theroux is deep
 Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
 And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
 Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
 I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
 I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
 To do them little ones
 Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
 Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
 Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
   could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
 He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
 Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
 Nah
 Still would stay on a bike most likely
 If it rains can't skate
 If only segways weren't banned
 Slippery when wet
 How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
 But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
 Unless those big ones
 ðŸ˜‚
 ðŸ¤”
 Because C's doesn't believe in future
 You still on e bullit?
 No
 Haven't worked for 2 weeks
 Might ask to go on walker circuit with the omnium
   do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
 And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
 Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
 Stops at all major clients
 So basically a dedicated van
 Or a single bullit
 ðŸ˜‚
 Lol yh
 Hahha helper dockets
 Chris ask for helper dockets when giving a lift to fellow walkers
 Now that's a banger
 15 an hour
 Berwins to broadgate all day
 ðŸ˜‚

 It's just Push bike but on foot
 I'm off it now it was shit
 Anybody know a couple looking for somewhere to live?
 Didn't know u were into that archie
 Walkers are the new fixie. Get over yourselves. All of you are replaceable!!
 They got these new whatever call cargo bikes
 Excel kids moving in.
 Fuck it. It's a open market kids. 5 days or nothing.

 Triple OG
 who are any of those people?
 Millennial messlifers
 Imagine begging a messenger how low is that
 Begging no future poor work ethic
 Only chance of owning a house is a floating one
 Is a scary world for us
 Spooky
 ðŸ˜‚
 Imagine
 How shit your life must be ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 That guy with the beard is abit off aswell
 Yeah heâ€™s next
 "I just wish society would hate me"
 Had some people back to mine yeah time we all went roof and he never left
 Like he left at like 7 literally I had to get into my pjs for him to get it
 "I wish even the security guards that come off a boat two weeks ago would look down on me"
 Yeah that guy
 What sort of fruit would plait his beard
 Macey was cussing him outside cannon st other week for joking about some terrorist thing
 Guys seems a douche
 And yeah beard thing is gross
 Yeah, when that thing happened in America, he was on WhatsApp saying, good, glad it wasn't me and shit like that.
 Little Connor went off at him
 Yeah that was it
 He was there too, screwing
 ðŸ˜‚
 He was crashing at pharaohs yard for a bit and had to leave the house every day but wasnâ€™t working so he would just lurk at loading bays
 ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
 Whats the guy in front trying to rest his elbow on
 I bumped into him at eversheds once and he literally followed me around for the rest of the day was so jarring
 What is in between the wheel and the handlebars
 Peak
 Then he tagged along to Crabtree and sat away from everyone on his own lol
 Think heâ€™s resting it on his dads knee
 Oh yh
   that is peak. Did he just have nothing else to do
 <Media omitted>
 Ayyyyy
 didnâ€™t he claim to have worked for 3d ?
 even though it was provably wrong
 It isn't hard to get a courier job though
 Why pretend?
 Alie
 Itâ€™s not a hard status to attain
 Init
 All u have to do is ask
 Kevs army
 What is the benefit of riding around all day pretending to work
 What if you get a puncture, then u are Â£5 down for that day
 Losing money
 Hahaha
 Hard
 Oh yeah that geezer with the beard came to crab asking for you
 For who?
 Tim?
 â€˜I want to meet London most famous courierâ€™
 That would kinda freak me out if he followed me about
 Nah Ellis
 ðŸ˜’ don't bring your mates to the house Ellis
 ðŸ˜‚
 He's now known as Clym Ellis's mate
 Hahahahahaha
 Yeah was bare awkward man
 He even crashed into the back of me while following me around
 "I heard Tim the infamous is powered off of cocaine alone"
 Iâ€™ve never seen or met Clym
 His name rhymes with grim thatâ€™s peak
 mf clym
 ðŸ‘Œ
 Real talk is it true
 He can follow me at work and pay for the nose beers on Friday
 Sounds good
 <Media omitted>
 Sorry, definitely wrong chat this time.

 How the fuck you even say that name
 Clam?
 Peado I reckon
 Haha init
 Yeh nonce or a fed
 Some picture appeared online of some airsofter in a MOD base, blurred faces, holding an SS flag... All hell broke loose in the airsoft Facebook world, hundreds of people defending them saying SS stands for scout sniper and it's an old American thing, no Nazi connotations .....
 ...then a friend found this image..
 <Media omitted>
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Yeaaaaaah
 Theyâ€™re nazis
 Fuckkk
 Unblurred faces and Hitler salutes. He posted the picture and said, is this ScoutSniper?
 All kicked off
 Then this cunt messaged my mate saying "I'll give you money, please take this picture down" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ™„
 So as I said, I'm just picking on kids on the wonderful world of the internet.
 Take the money and out him anyway
 My mate works for the mail
 Get a pay out and ruin a life ðŸ¤·â€
â™‚
 That's what I said, my friend took it down, because he's not a cunt.
 So I posted it, hoping for a pay out.
 Cash4nazis.co.uk
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Hahaha fuck
 Iâ€™ll post it for the pay out
 Anyone see that vice thing about war reenactments and it's nazis
 Pretty funny
 You seen the video of Gemma stacking it?
 Yeh amazing
 I think she's such a tramp I loved it
 So good

 So good
 Ohshit
 Saw Gemma's mum in Pret in bluewater today
 Charlotte sussed her
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Hahahaha
 Sorry, ahem... Gemma from TOWIE?

 DW I got your scrubby self
 Thank you
 <Media omitted>
 halp
 That bike looks nice and illegal
 â€œI felt unsafeâ€
 for real
 since when have they had speed bumps in the park?
 Since we became the only place in the world that it's deemed acceptable to wear full lycra to ride to work
 Which I assume is exactly what you're doing, Sam
 Full regents park rouleurs kit, s works aero helmet and pink rapha shoes
 the helmet hasnâ€™t arrived yet
 but yes
 speaking of commuting
 for some reason i want one of those van moof bikes
 the ones that look like they are made from scaffolding
 The zsa zsa special
 but you canâ€™t buy the pedal back brake version anymore
 yeah exactly
 i rate them
 I love them
 iâ€™ve been keeping an eye out but havenâ€™t found one for sale yet
 the new ones have disk breaks and donâ€™t seem as chill
 https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F263274145027
 that looks great
 Theyâ€™re steezed out
 Really, no pedal back? Hmm. You could probably get a pedal back nexus hub on your iribe if you wanted to try and outdo Tim for kool fixie bike reattribution
 I wonder if theyâ€™re nice to work on
 They kinda look like tanks
 reallllly?
 But alu frame
 this is tempting
 <Media omitted>
 gemma?
 STOP EVERYTHING YOURE DOING.. THE BEST VIDEO IN THE WORLD IS BACK ON YOUTUBE
 https://youtu.be/4wILoM4lMJE
 Omg
 The build up was good but he didn't even film the burst through the ceiling properly
 Is this worth the data?
 Yeah why not
 Better than Sam riding through the park
 At least I know Jake will love it. I've been waiting for the return of that video for literally like 8 years haha
 ðŸ˜¢
 Sorry sam
 I too hate those speed bumps. What's worse is they're vicious cycle specific ones
 "Marvin's ruined the party"
 "ILL PAY FA DE RUUF"
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Gutted they didn't get him coming through the ruuf
 Innit
 Hahaha
 I mean they kinda do, but probably the guy filming it doesn't actually believe Marvin is gonna go through with it. Also, blantant disregard for the woman's condition after the fact. Probably still lying there 12 years on
 Ruuf>woman
 Yh she coulda broken her hip
 I did a photo shoot for van moof in a Paul smith suit for tank magazine once
 No lie

 Not really tho. He said they weren't using pushbikes any more then hired jack Jones next day
 Yeh I remember that
 He's a snake
 I did use feedback he asked for to shit on all the just eat kit + the app so I guess he just thought I'd continue being a pain in the arse if he kept me on
 Those fucking jerseys tho.. who's gona wear that in hackney and feel safe
 whereâ€™s the new crabtree now crabtree is shut?
 Stokey spoons for the east lit

 Mr popular
 That's what I said, this is gonna get annoying fast
 Armin if you don't come in today I'm just gonna keep putting jobs in and out your file
 Why do we need another rider in jay you serious
 He ain't going to be happy with the day
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 I might text back the courier app and ask for nudes
 Don't worry, he's definitely not coming
 Omg please do
 Ask how much the app shots a gram for
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 @citysprint â€˜got da flake????â€™
 Iâ€™m still at elly pret, not even a Bloomberg in sight
 The roads were suuuuuper dead this morning
 Mad ting
 We stopped giving bloomys out until later
 Ah
 After 10 at least
 Makes sense
 Tbf the way itâ€™s looking Iâ€™ll probably still be here so ðŸ¤·â€
â™‚
   you in today?
 Iâ€™m so lonely
 Good that Bloomberg morning situation is bollocks
 The whole bloomberg situation is bollocks
 Morning or not
 Yeh true
 The 3quid into the west end thing for a larger then top box does sometimes really wind me up
 It's shit
 Yup
 But like we always say
 We are fodder
 If it wasn't such a big account id definitely encourage boycotting it
 But when you got 11 standers SE1 in the morning
 It helps to disperse
 Yeah exactly
 11 starters se now?
 Fuck
 Itâ€™s not the best docket but you can make like a tenner v easily and it brings you into the work
 And Jesus
 Thatâ€™d explain it
 Been empty an hour
 Yeah Tim, it ain't me you and neems there at 8 anymore
 <Media omitted>
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Yess
 Fuck
 Bloomys as it happens
 That used to be the vibe hahaha if you were out before 8 all them more London pre books
 Ahh those early mornings and now ya boy can't even remember where Leather Lane
 Oi if you get to of the SG double run arounds but ones the ec4 leg and the other docket is the ec3 one you can't put waiting on both can you?
 At the Austin friars bit
 Yeah you can surely
 Austin friars then blackfriars one yeah?
 There two separate runs basically init so it makes sense right?
 Yeh and the Austin birchin lane one aswell
 Yeah don't see why you wouldn't!
 Yeah course
 I can just feel Kevin in Thailand shaking at the idea
 I hope this wasn't just to show off that you had a good docket haha
 No no
 I'm milking the fuck out of it though
 On a slow start like today
 ðŸ˜µðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Haha
 Woi honest hour here though there all fucked at deuche
 Yeah I had a docket going there this morn get coaâ€™d coz it was a bundle of 29 keyboards
 Hahahaha
 29
 Alex would've but them on his back
 Still.. 90Â£ delivery. I coulda swooped in and been home by 10am
 Dun kno
 I got 8 this morn, not too bad
 But my xda is playing up anytime I try to go to that manifest page, so my entire morning has been on paper
 Remind me again what I pay Â£20 a week for ðŸ˜’
 I'm off today, I still got a call from Citysprint though you did Mark me down yeah?
 Hahah who rang you?
 Kevin ain't in
 He's the only one who cares about riders not being in
 Though mind you no lie he was joking about me not comming in at Nigel's drinks but he also condoned the reasons for not common in and said at your age that's what you should be do doin g
 Mixed signals
 Kevin is actually probably a bit insane
 Wonder how many Thai hookers heâ€™s murdered so far
 Jake
 Bring us something nice yeah thanks
 Pmsl
 Never forget accidentally saying to him that he had to go to Thailand to check if his daughter was still alive
 Fuck hahaha

 Is it just me or do you ever get reminded of something that you deeply regret and can't shake the dread for a good few days?
 Asking for a friend
 Hahaha most Mondays mate

 <Media omitted>
 Throwing everything out the back of his van
 Probably because he makes less then us and has to pay out more
 So fucked for them lot
 Then there bosses higher 10 cargo bikes and put them on the circuit aswell

 Namaste bitch

 I have learnt Armin, you're right I shall take that on board
 What was the issue so we can laugh about it for a minute
 Then help
 You know how this chat works
 ðŸ˜‚
 Respecting women
 Hmmm go on
 Did you say daaaaaaaamn out loud in front of a gyal?
 I've done that before
 By accident
 Was very ashamed
 I don't know
 It's a tricky one
 Plenty of girls talk shit about boys in the face as well
 Yeh all about just being mature I guess that's what this kind of thing boils down to
 Basically everyone is afraid of flirting with girls cause ain't pc
 Dunno man
 Daaamn ain't that bad
 ðŸ™„
 Just regret it, donâ€™t do it again and move on
 And donâ€™t tell ur missus
 Always tell your missus everything
 A partnership based on secrets and lies
 Ain't up to god's standards
 ðŸ˜‚
 What happenend though billy?
 Can't be nothing someone in here ain't done before
 Boys/young men make mistakes init
 Grope incident?
 Oh I ain't done that
 Unless it was consented
 But then they usually have the regret
 ðŸ˜‚
 I smacked some asses when younger
 But smiles back made it better I guess
 When I was growing up that was a norm
 Any word on Alfie?
 We was with him the other day he seemed pretty down to be fair
 We were with him last night. And Dylan was getting him absolutely wrecked.
 Damn yeh with his money ha
 Did he get on it again?
 Hmmmm
 Got a girl sectioned
 Had a noble street earlier and that was her last name so reminded me
 Lmao
 I mean if sheâ€™s nuts sheâ€™s nuts
 Sheâ€™s probably better for it
 If someone gets sectioned its most likely more than 1 problem
 Real shite
 Bill you prob made a favour
 If feel very bad about it will come out for a drink
 Just not south
 Well what did she do?
 Nah it was my fault she was a depressed badders when I met her and I fucked her over
 I've know a girl before to get sectioned and the way she got it was her own good
 Nah man life is life you know
 That's her mentality
 Suicide threats etc
 Sad as that is
 Would of been you or someone else
 When people are mentality ill there mentality I'll
 Look mate
 What happened to tim
 Wow... First and possibly last time this could ever happen: I just got asked to take my clothes off because they thought I was a stripogram hahah
 Someone to to Godiva in berger house and finish the job!
 Hold on tom this chats getting deep and meaningful for once we ain't just talking about my hilarious coke habit,royales and people not comming in

 Go on bill

 U lot never let billy get a word in lol

 Chris, at the end of your intentions were good
 Don't feel guilty
 But unless u promised her ud take care of her or some shit, she made her decisions
 Not everyone is a match

 Also never know how far ppl will take a dark side
 And how much ctrl
 Over it
 Wodju call me?
 Jelly abs

 How was redhook there tom?
 I've had the same experience too by the way, just to (if nothing else) demonstrate how worryingly common this stuff is. Even more odd is I recently found out I live next door to the house where she tried to commit suicide. We are actually friends again now #thecircleofnearlyendingyourlife

 Shit son
 These men on a madness
 Is this big news then
 Like a mini brexit
 But without an official vote right?
 <Media omitted>
 Hehehehe
 where does this group stand? do people want a one nation world or independent nation states?
 Nuclear blackout
 Free coke party
 Or that
 Tough ballot thatâ€™d be
 i sort of get depressed with all this devolution shit. iâ€™m all for the world government. itâ€™s sort of sad to see so much backwards thinking in the world. but tbh i know nothing about this sort of thing, so my opinion is probably stupid
 Well think about it hundred years ago nations were always split up stuff changes with time
 Maybe it's just time for change
 You know what I mean?
 Demoacracy has to be practiced
 Can't just be the fake idea that it is
 You don't need to know that much about it. A load of entitled twats with what they consider to be defined cultural history, want to separate themselves from the rest of the country so they can more directly govern their policies and finances. I'm sure they actually just want to kick out a load of foreigners and stop the 'plague' of tourism. Spain is not exactly the most forward thinking nation in Western Europe and it is also one that struggles with it's history
 Word
 Also, this is like Cornwall just deciding for itself that it wants to be independent without checking with Theresa May
 3 lions on me shirt
 Unfortunately because there's like fuck all else in Spain, Madrid worries about losing Barcelona and the revenue it provides from tourism etc
 well yeah. i'm not as eloquent as tom, but basically people thinking their country or are defines them are pleb tier thinkers. fuck your shit bit of land. grow up and join the rest of the world.
 *area
 It's a crazy world
 People are obsessed with identity
 Same as really I never know where I stand
 Might actually class myself as a fluid nationality
 Well what's bad is it's being sold to people her like brexit
 Trans nationality
 Like a working class revolt
 But what's bad is the way Madrid have handled it
 But even locals pro leaving don't want it to be handled like the way the Catalan government are doing so either
 That was some bar talk last. Johny
 Last night sorry
   where do you stand? do you dream of living in mega city 1?
   who's the Canadian qwenger you're chilling with
 Could it be love?
 Yeah no worries. I mean I'm all for places being able to decide things for themselves, if they think it has an effect on their cultural identity or whatever. Champagne only made in champagne (don't tell them it's just cheap fizzy wine). If it's a thinly veiled way of being exclusionary or xenophobic then just go fuck yourselves. Could've sworn Spain was a Muslim state for years anyway, just like we're all Norman Vikings. Join the identity fluid revolution !
 it was a muslim state yeah
 Any pics?

 It's a bit more to that whole thing
 Cornwall does indeed have its own language
 And flag
 What
 But yeah
 At the end then
 <Media omitted>
 yes it does
 If you don't wanna  relate to the rest of the country you should be able to leave
 I donâ€™t wanna relate to England so Can I be my own independent state?
 Pls say yes
 You don't  already ask jays neighbors
 Hahaha
 Donâ€™t paint us all with the same brush
 ðŸ˜‚
 My reasons are different
 <Media omitted>
 Mad
 What I wanted really to say when someone is trying to gain independence there will be no legal vote
 Like Lithuania got their independence it started out as illegal vote
 Gotta revolt son
 It always does
 Overthrow the state
 Bun down Babylon seen
 And if Cornish peeps wanted their independence I would support it
 Why not
 Also Cornwall has a population of like 50 people so no one really gives a fuck
 But yeah Iâ€™d back it
 Lewisham should be an independent state
 no one a fan of the cultural melting pot?
 Nah
 White is right
 Fuk u mean
 Lol jk
 Tho jay probably isnâ€™t
 It's not that , cultural melting pot is fine, it will happen no matter if they're independent or not
 I am right
 I spoke to a guy yesterday who lived there for a long time
 Ah I was gona try n say something can't be arsed
 Dobit

 OJ
 Tbh I was contemplating flaking but realised Iâ€™ve probably only made a oner in 3 days
 Mate I've mugged myself off don't worry about that
 OJ Simpson murdered his wife man
 I need the ps
 Hangovers ain't bad you always shake it off
 But people forget he was an amazing running back and would've won loads of Super Bowls with theRaiders....
 Itâ€™s true
 But he didn't because he killed his wife then drove 20mph down the motorway
 But crashing and being so waved you contemplated just staying there as it's closer to work
 With loads of Feds telling him not to kill himself so you know
 Plug my xda in to the nearest fucking tree
 You pick your claim to fame
 he was like 40+ when that happened
 So?
 mainly acting in comedies
 Tom Brady is 40, and he won a Super Bowl last years
 reaaaaaalllly
 You're old, I didn't say you can't run did I?
 Yeh
 Quarter backs can get old
 Fucking ageism I'm 19 and I've done my back in
 i would have thought it was a young mans game
 nah
 There the shot callers
 Depends how much you et sacked nigga
 Experience is key
 Exactly
 but yeah, oj was basically just an actor at that point
 That's why Tom = GOAT
 You seen that Netflix oj thing?
 With coconut junior or whatever his name is
 Cuban junior or whatever haha
 I actually have lol
 Cuban junior LOOL
 It's good init
 Hahahaha what's his name?
 I dunno
 Cuban junior now
 Payton manning is the goat
 Fuck you Sam
 You can't say that he would t have made a comeback because he was in prison
 (Don't make comebacks EVER)
 An example.
 ðŸ˜‚
 Peyton Manning did nothing, for nobody, never. Tom Brady is the GOAT.
 Fair play though
 But he's still the ONLY player ever to rush for over 2000 yards in the regular season
 Anyway, he's out f prison now so probably gonna remarry and remurder (or kidnap)
 Bets anyone?
 2000 rushing yards in a season
 Damn
 I didn't know the facts
 Regular season
 he played his last game like 10 years before (not) murdering his wife
 and then went to prison like 10 years after that
 he had plenty of time to make a comeback
 the oj trial was quality tv though. only bettered by 11/9
 lol who care
 He could make a comeback now
 ðŸ˜‚
 He's out of prison!!!
 He still has plenty of time
 It's peak though
 If he never got dropped(or quit to take up murder) he would've actually been on  one of the best teams
 Ever
 Under the best coach, ever
 But my NIGHA retired without a ring. No heart
 He's only 70.
 He got like 3m or 30m for being acquitted of murder to
 I'm sure that will buy you new limbs, or tom Brady's genes
 <Media omitted>
 he already was on the best team ever
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 No he was not
 Arguably the most failed team to never win a super bowl
 Or make the playoffs in the last 17 years loool
 i was talking about police squad
 He got traded to the best team, they didn't want him
 Oh looool
 I wanna watch 11/9
 Who's the fat guy on the left
 And did they actually let him play himself
 Or is that apple juice Simpson?
 His twin ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Naked_Gun
 he was in loads of films
 in fact
 you know what
 >successful nfl player
 >actor
 >author
 >criminal mastermind
 GOAT
 tom brady is shit compared to the juice
 Loool hey man
 You gotta give him a few years to kill his vixen wife Giselle
 He still ain't retired
 And he didn't fumble the ball in his second to last play like a little bitch nigga
 I agree with your >'s tho
 He's a fucking mastermind lol
 He's roaming free in SF as we speak, THE JUICE IS LOOSE!!!!!!
 Thanks for putting me on tho lool i did not know he did all thiscool shut
 I thought he was good fora bit, probably became a reporter then got nicked
 I'm gonna spend the day looking deep into the past of OJ
 the juice was beloved by americans
 Heâ€™s learnt his lesson
 Allen Iverson is the goat
 Yeah sorry
 I have to set examples
 Do you not learn?
 If he comes back whoever guesses who his next goat is wins
 Prize is a secret
 The juice was beloved lool
 I'm starting to get heartbroken reading this emotional rollercoaster
 Once I watch those shows u said Sam I'm gonna be infatuated
