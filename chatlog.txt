28/08/2017, 18:38 - Jay: Yeah you're totally right. I called em, I refused to buy a new one as mine had been taken and said I'll just liberate one from somewhere and the geezer didn't seem fussed

08/09/2017, 13:30 - Chris: That's mad tho reading that
08/09/2017, 13:31 - Chris: So.. being gay shows outwardly in actual facial structure

08/09/2017, 13:34 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: it's just a camera trained on stereotypically 'gay' people
08/09/2017, 13:35 - Tim: I think no one was really vibing this week
08/09/2017, 13:35 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: it says that in the article
08/09/2017, 13:35 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: although the bit after that about facial sctructure is somewhat interesting
08/09/2017, 13:35 - Chris: Well it's experience of gay people was taken from people who are openly gay
08/09/2017, 13:36 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: and on a dating site
08/09/2017, 13:36 - Chris: From the dating websites yh
08/09/2017, 13:36 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: so probably playing up just how gay they look

08/09/2017, 13:37 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: it's interesting that this is being funded though
08/09/2017, 13:37 - Chris: I think everyone's loving the neural network shit right now
08/09/2017, 13:38 - Chris: Probably why
08/09/2017, 13:38 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: yeah
08/09/2017, 13:38 - Chris: How it's useful to society tho I don't know
08/09/2017, 13:42 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: the trying to pin point gay people by looks alone does seem odd

11/09/2017, 09:13 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: i genuinely can't understand how he could survive a 2 minute conversation without being sectioned
11/09/2017, 09:15 - Jay: Because everyone in the building just wants to avoid him
11/09/2017, 09:15 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: ðŸ˜‚

11/09/2017, 09:15 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: but someone must have spoken to him
11/09/2017, 09:16 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: surely he must have said "i'm princess diana" to somebody

11/09/2017, 09:30 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: i think the fraud claims were because he said he had a bunch of money off some people
11/09/2017, 09:30 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: but that was most likely delusion

22/09/2017, 11:22 - â€ª+44 7446 988694â€¬: Yeah I mean they're all shit
22/09/2017, 11:22 - â€ª+44 7446 988694â€¬: But uber doesn't have exclusivity when it comes to shit drivers
22/09/2017, 11:22 - Nic: 95% of cabbies are excellent drivers.
22/09/2017, 11:22 - â€ª+44 7446 988694â€¬: Loads of addi lee's are terrible too
22/09/2017, 11:22 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: loads of cabbies are shit too
22/09/2017, 11:22 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: some arenâ€™t

22/09/2017, 11:23 - Bleswon Joss: cyclists are the problem
22/09/2017, 11:23 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: but uberâ€™s driving skills arenâ€™t why theyâ€™ve been shut down
22/09/2017, 11:23 - Bleswon Joss: did you not hear about the murderous illegal cyclists
22/09/2017, 11:23 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: is this just the work of black cabs?
22/09/2017, 11:23 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: some shady back room dealings
22/09/2017, 11:24 - Bleswon Joss: probably
22/09/2017, 11:25 - Nic: I don't think there are any conspiracies here
22/09/2017, 11:25 - â€ª+44 7446 988694â€¬: I swear black cabbies have been protesting about their rates and shit though
22/09/2017, 11:25 - â€ª+44 7446 988694â€¬: I dunno if they're that close with TfL either
22/09/2017, 11:26 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: but whatâ€™s the reason
22/09/2017, 11:26 - Nic: They're taking the piss out of tfl's loop holes, course they hate them
22/09/2017, 11:27 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: that article basically says â€œthey ainâ€™t puckaâ€
22/09/2017, 11:27 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: in what regard? i know nothing of tfl or how uber operate
22/09/2017, 11:29 - Nic: I don't know the specific details... the 10 minutes between booking an uber and it coming
22/09/2017, 11:30 - Nic: That's a rule of a private hire cab, there has to be a certain amount of time between you booking the taxi and it arriving. They often break this rule apparently
22/09/2017, 11:31 - Nic: Apart from the fact driving along on a while using a phone is illegal. but for some reason people are allowed to build a business around doing just that.
22/09/2017, 11:31 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: they click a button at the start of a journey and one at the end
22/09/2017, 11:31 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: itâ€™s just sat nav
22/09/2017, 11:31 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: like every cabbie in london
22/09/2017, 11:32 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/26/ubers-london-licence-renewed-for-only-four-months
22/09/2017, 11:32 - Nic: Every single cabbie in London uses a phone?
22/09/2017, 11:32 - Nic: I don't think so
22/09/2017, 11:34 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: i donâ€™t have any data on that. but a decent amount of cabbies iâ€™ve seen have the same setup as uber
22/09/2017, 11:34 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: a lot use the phones to work out the cost of the trip
22/09/2017, 11:35 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: just seems like cabbies trying to run a monopoly
22/09/2017, 11:37 - Nic: Well if you were a cabbie who bought a Â£40.000 taxi and spent three years of his life training to be a cabbie and someone comes in and completely undercuts you and the tfl tells you that you aren't allowed to then combat that by dropping your rates, what are you going to do other than complain?!
22/09/2017, 11:38 - Nic: You can't keeping linking his back to cabbies. They're just doing what anybody would do in their situation..... trying to keep their job and livelihood.
22/09/2017, 11:38 - Zima Billy: Yeah I hate em both but I'm on the side of the cabs
22/09/2017, 11:39 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: so if technology comes along to drastically improve an archaic service in terms of a consumer it shouldnâ€™t be allowed?
22/09/2017, 11:40 - Nic: Not if it causes this many problems
22/09/2017, 11:41 - Nic: What's wrong with throwing your hand in the air and paying a properly self employed person a little more to take you somewhere
22/09/2017, 11:41 - Nic: If you want to get someone to take you somewhere, it's not going to be cheap
22/09/2017, 11:42 - Nic: I'm sure dial a cab or get it do deals near enough to uber prices.
22/09/2017, 11:42 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: possibly so
22/09/2017, 11:43 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: but uber had a really streamlined and useful service
22/09/2017, 11:43 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: millions of people would use and love it
22/09/2017, 11:44 - Nic: And the car ownership in London has gone up by some ridiculous percentage
22/09/2017, 11:44 - Nic: When TfL has been campaigning for years to stop people driving in the city.
22/09/2017, 11:44 - Chris: Your fault for investing so much in a job any fool can do with an iPhone and a prius
22/09/2017, 11:44 - Tom: Being a cabbie is a totally dead job. You may as well be a coalminer. Literally 2/3s of cabs have no one in yet they all cream like 30k+
22/09/2017, 11:44 - Nic: We don't need a more congested city.
22/09/2017, 11:45 - Tom: True though, Gett is the perfect combo
22/09/2017, 11:45 - Nic: I don't even believe in adi lee
22/09/2017, 11:45 - Tom: Everyone download Gett. I've probably got a discount code
22/09/2017, 11:45 - Chris: What's get
22/09/2017, 11:46 - Nic: If you're an HGV driver, you have to take a stupid test.
22/09/2017, 11:46 - Nic: If you're a cabbie you have to take a test.
22/09/2017, 11:46 - Tom: Black cabs but with uber-like interface. Actually predates Uber, I reckon
22/09/2017, 11:46 - Tom: What about if you're a courier?
22/09/2017, 11:47 - Nic: Everyone should have a propper licence to carry people, whether it's a black cab licence or something else. People should be checked and licenced to make sure they can competently do the job.
22/09/2017, 11:47 - Chris: Driving license?
22/09/2017, 11:47 - Chris: I mean there's no extra skills involved in having people in the back seat
22/09/2017, 11:48 - Tom: (noodle was contemplating working for Uber)
22/09/2017, 11:48 - Nic: You are responsible to that persons wellbeing whilst they are in your car.
22/09/2017, 11:49 - Nic: And the amount of uber accidents I have seen with my own eyes, let alone the rest of the ones I don't see, demonstrates that some of them aren't capable of completing the simple task of taking someone from A to B
22/09/2017, 11:50 - Nic: Let alone driving on busy London roads with cyclists, HGV's and more complicated road networks.
22/09/2017, 11:51 - â€ª+44 7590 573104â€¬: I back black cabs but they're too expensive and racist
22/09/2017, 11:51 - Chris: What would you see that they're expected to do over and beyond a normal driver is expected?
22/09/2017, 11:51 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: so when automated cars are a thing in say 10-20 years, that will better because itâ€™s safer. so youâ€™ll be happy that the cabbies donâ€™t have a business model and go extinct
22/09/2017, 11:52 - Chris: Orange cone slalom course?
22/09/2017, 11:53 - Chris: Reverse handbrake turn
22/09/2017, 11:53 - Chris: ??
22/09/2017, 11:53 - â€ª+44 7590 573104â€¬: Drifting
22/09/2017, 11:53 - Nic: Carry a passenger..
22/09/2017, 11:53 - Nic: Who is paying a fare
22/09/2017, 11:53 - â€ª+44 7590 573104â€¬: Would pay a premium for drift skillz
22/09/2017, 11:53 - Nic: To you
22/09/2017, 11:53 - Chris: So, what's gonna be in the test
22/09/2017, 11:53 - Chris: Don't slam the doors?
22/09/2017, 11:54 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: should the vehicles be specifically licensed for passenger safety too?
22/09/2017, 11:54 - Chris: Probably. Extra wide seatbelts
22/09/2017, 11:54 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: whatâ€™s the crumple zone situation in a black cab?
22/09/2017, 11:55 - Chris: Roll cages maybe
22/09/2017, 11:56 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: ðŸ˜‚
22/09/2017, 11:56 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: iâ€™m being serious though
22/09/2017, 11:57 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: as a passenger youâ€™re safer in a prius than with some of the old shit mobiles the ageing cabbies use
22/09/2017, 11:57 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: although i assume modern black cabs are designed in a similar style to other cars and probably as safe
22/09/2017, 11:58 - Chris: If people are happy to pay extra for the service of a black cab then all power to them
22/09/2017, 11:59 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: yep
22/09/2017, 11:59 - Chris: But to shout and scream about the competition when it arrives
22/09/2017, 11:59 - Chris: With a better business model
22/09/2017, 11:59 - Chris: Instead of adapting ..
22/09/2017, 11:59 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: but consumer choice is a wonderful thing
22/09/2017, 11:59 - Chris: Yeah it is
22/09/2017, 11:59 - Nic: They can't adapt chris
22/09/2017, 12:00 - Chris: Darwinism init
22/09/2017, 12:00 - Nic: That's the whole point of their arguement.
22/09/2017, 12:00 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: so should they not protest the people who set the rules
22/09/2017, 12:00 - Chris: So ... Move on ? Who owes them anything?
22/09/2017, 12:00 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: and not just moan because a different company offers an attractive service
22/09/2017, 12:01 - Chris: The selfless service they've provided to the citizenship of london
22/09/2017, 12:01 - Nic: The amount of sweeping statements being made is outrageous in this conversation
22/09/2017, 12:02 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: youâ€™ve made quite a few yourself nic
22/09/2017, 12:03 - â€ª+44 7590 573104â€¬: Shout outs to racism, lbc 97.3,  green coffee huts, an inability to adapt to current technology and poor driving
22/09/2017, 12:06 - Nic: I'll take Chris's point of view here "fuck'em, should have known better than to invest all their money in a dodger business plan."
22/09/2017, 12:07 - â€ª+44 7590 573104â€¬: ðŸ¤·â€
â™‚
22/09/2017, 12:09 - Chris: U don't get my point of view tho
22/09/2017, 12:09 - Nic: It's not mine
22/09/2017, 12:10 - Nic: I'm applying yours to their situation
22/09/2017, 12:10 - Chris: People lobbying for legislation change to benefit themselves over competition isn't right
22/09/2017, 12:10 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: ^
22/09/2017, 12:10 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: this
22/09/2017, 12:10 - Chris: We'll, u don't get my point of view like I said
22/09/2017, 12:10 - Chris: This is the result
22/09/2017, 12:10 - Nic: So in that case, uber shouldn't fight it
22/09/2017, 12:11 - Nic: Hey should just leave it alone.
22/09/2017, 12:11 - Nic: Because they aren't allowed to change legislation to benefit their drivers?
22/09/2017, 12:11 - Chris: You don't really bring any consideration of what other people are saying
22/09/2017, 12:11 - Chris: So what's the point
22/09/2017, 12:11 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: they donâ€™t need to change anything
22/09/2017, 12:11 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: they existed
22/09/2017, 12:12 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: ltda were lobbying for changes to bully out uber
22/09/2017, 12:13 - Nic: They existed possibly by bending the rules a bit in their favour and TfL taking a leanient attitude to their operations.
22/09/2017, 12:14 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: did they break anything accept the 10 minute rule?
22/09/2017, 12:14 - Chris: Imagine vans lobbying to ban cargo bikes
22/09/2017, 12:14 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: because ..... ummmm.... is quite like to be picked up in less than 10 mins
22/09/2017, 12:14 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: thatâ€™s a quality service
22/09/2017, 12:15 - Chris: No, it's a 10 minute break in between drop off and pick up
22/09/2017, 12:15 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: ah
22/09/2017, 12:15 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: like an anti hustle rule
22/09/2017, 12:15 - Chris: It's a law to separate minicabs from black taxis
22/09/2017, 12:15 - Nic: As I said earlier, I'm not saying I know all the rules, I'm just saying an example of one I know about
22/09/2017, 12:15 - Chris: U pay for the cab + the license, u get that benefit
22/09/2017, 12:16 - Nic: The article someone posted talked about what I just said
22/09/2017, 12:16 - Chris: So, the law chooses one group over another
22/09/2017, 12:17 - Nic: The law chooses the group that are in favour, rather than one that might bend the rules
22/09/2017, 12:17 - Nic: Ofcourse
22/09/2017, 12:17 - Chris: What?
22/09/2017, 12:17 - Chris: No it should never work like that
22/09/2017, 12:17 - Chris: The law should then favour the police over the criminal
22/09/2017, 12:17 - Chris: That would work a treat right?
22/09/2017, 12:17 - Chris: A biased law
22/09/2017, 12:18 - Nic: What are you even saying
22/09/2017, 12:18 - Bleswon Joss: this is borin. back to postin almonds plz
22/09/2017, 12:18 - Nic: You're taking this wildly out of context man
22/09/2017, 12:18 - Chris: Law shouldn't favour one group over another
22/09/2017, 12:18 - Chris: It's discrimination
22/09/2017, 12:19 - Nic: I can't even be bothered anymore
22/09/2017, 12:19 - â€ª+44 7446 988694â€¬: Crab emoji tree emoji question mark

22/09/2017, 12:22 - â€ª+44 7590 573104â€¬: How many women aren't gonna have a safe journey home now that they can't afford an alternative

27/09/2017, 14:38 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: marketing and stashing the worlds supply so that you artificially increase rarity does wonders for profit margin

18/10/2017, 20:10 - Chris: @447875716351 could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Nah
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Still would stay on a bike most likely

18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit

18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Stops at all major clients
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: So basically a dedicated van

18/10/2017, 18:58 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
18/10/2017, 18:58 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
18/10/2017, 18:59 - Tim: Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
18/10/2017, 19:41 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: To do them little ones
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
18/10/2017, 19:45 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
18/10/2017, 20:09 - Chris: Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
18/10/2017, 20:10 - Chris: @447875716351 could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Nah
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Still would stay on a bike most likely
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: If it rains can't skate
18/10/2017, 20:17 - Chris: If only segways weren't banned
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Slippery when wet
18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
18/10/2017, 20:18 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Unless those big ones
18/10/2017, 20:18 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: ðŸ˜‚

18/10/2017, 20:20 - Chris: Might ask to go on walker circuit with the omnium
18/10/2017, 20:22 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: @447875716351 do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
18/10/2017, 20:23 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Stops at all major clients
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: So basically a dedicated van
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Or a single bullit
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: ðŸ˜‚

18/10/2017, 18:58 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
18/10/2017, 18:58 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
18/10/2017, 18:59 - Tim: Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
18/10/2017, 19:41 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: To do them little ones
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
18/10/2017, 19:45 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
18/10/2017, 20:09 - Chris: Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
18/10/2017, 20:10 - Chris: @447875716351 could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Nah
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Still would stay on a bike most likely
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: If it rains can't skate
18/10/2017, 20:17 - Chris: If only segways weren't banned
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Slippery when wet
18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
18/10/2017, 20:18 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Unless those big ones

18/10/2017, 20:20 - Chris: Might ask to go on walker circuit with the omnium
18/10/2017, 20:22 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: @447875716351 do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
18/10/2017, 20:23 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Stops at all major clients
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: So basically a dedicated van
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Or a single bullit

18/10/2017, 19:41 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: To do them little ones
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
18/10/2017, 19:45 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
18/10/2017, 20:09 - Chris: Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
18/10/2017, 20:10 - Chris: @447875716351 could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Nah
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Still would stay on a bike most likely
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: If it rains can't skate

18/10/2017, 20:23 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Stops at all major clients
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: So basically a dedicated van
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Or a single bullit

18/10/2017, 18:49 - Tim: Go on billy
18/10/2017, 18:52 - Tim: Damn this new Louie Theroux is deep
18/10/2017, 18:58 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
18/10/2017, 18:58 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
18/10/2017, 18:59 - Tim: Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
18/10/2017, 19:41 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: To do them little ones
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
18/10/2017, 19:45 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
18/10/2017, 20:09 - Chris: Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
18/10/2017, 20:10 - Chris: @447875716351 could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Nah
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Still would stay on a bike most likely
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: If it rains can't skate
18/10/2017, 20:17 - Chris: If only segways weren't banned
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Slippery when wet
18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
18/10/2017, 20:18 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Unless those big ones
18/10/2017, 20:18 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: ðŸ˜‚
18/10/2017, 20:18 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: ðŸ¤”

18/10/2017, 20:20 - Chris: No
18/10/2017, 20:20 - Chris: Haven't worked for 2 weeks
18/10/2017, 20:20 - Chris: Might ask to go on walker circuit with the omnium
18/10/2017, 20:22 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: @447875716351 do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
18/10/2017, 20:23 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Stops at all major clients
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: So basically a dedicated van
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Or a single bullit
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: ðŸ˜‚

18/10/2017, 18:58 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
18/10/2017, 18:59 - Tim: Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
18/10/2017, 19:41 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: To do them little ones
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
18/10/2017, 19:45 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
18/10/2017, 20:09 - Chris: Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
18/10/2017, 20:10 - Chris: @447875716351 could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Nah
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Still would stay on a bike most likely
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: If it rains can't skate
18/10/2017, 20:17 - Chris: If only segways weren't banned
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Slippery when wet

18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
18/10/2017, 20:18 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Unless those big ones

18/10/2017, 20:22 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: @447875716351 do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
18/10/2017, 20:23 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Stops at all major clients
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: So basically a dedicated van
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Or a single bullit

18/10/2017, 18:58 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
18/10/2017, 18:58 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
18/10/2017, 18:59 - Tim: Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
18/10/2017, 19:41 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: To do them little ones
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
18/10/2017, 19:45 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
18/10/2017, 20:09 - Chris: Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
18/10/2017, 20:10 - Chris: @447875716351 could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Nah
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Still would stay on a bike most likely
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: If it rains can't skate
18/10/2017, 20:17 - Chris: If only segways weren't banned
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Slippery when wet
18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
18/10/2017, 20:18 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Unless those big ones
18/10/2017, 20:18 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: ðŸ˜‚

18/10/2017, 20:20 - Chris: Haven't worked for 2 weeks
18/10/2017, 20:20 - Chris: Might ask to go on walker circuit with the omnium
18/10/2017, 20:22 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: @447875716351 do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
18/10/2017, 20:23 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Stops at all major clients
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: So basically a dedicated van
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Or a single bullit
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: ðŸ˜‚

18/10/2017, 18:58 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
18/10/2017, 18:58 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
18/10/2017, 18:59 - Tim: Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
18/10/2017, 19:41 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: To do them little ones
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
18/10/2017, 19:45 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
18/10/2017, 20:09 - Chris: Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
18/10/2017, 20:10 - Chris: @447875716351 could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Nah
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Still would stay on a bike most likely
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: If it rains can't skate
18/10/2017, 20:17 - Chris: If only segways weren't banned
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Slippery when wet
18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
18/10/2017, 20:18 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Unless those big ones

18/10/2017, 20:22 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: @447875716351 do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
18/10/2017, 20:23 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Stops at all major clients
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: So basically a dedicated van
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Or a single bullit

18/10/2017, 18:58 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
18/10/2017, 18:58 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
18/10/2017, 18:59 - Tim: Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
18/10/2017, 19:41 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: To do them little ones
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
18/10/2017, 19:45 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
18/10/2017, 20:09 - Chris: Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
18/10/2017, 20:10 - Chris: @447875716351 could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Nah
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Still would stay on a bike most likely
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: If it rains can't skate
18/10/2017, 20:17 - Chris: If only segways weren't banned
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Slippery when wet
18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
18/10/2017, 20:18 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Unless those big ones

18/10/2017, 20:20 - Chris: Might ask to go on walker circuit with the omnium
18/10/2017, 20:22 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: @447875716351 do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
18/10/2017, 20:23 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Stops at all major clients
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: So basically a dedicated van
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Or a single bullit

18/10/2017, 18:58 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
18/10/2017, 18:58 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
18/10/2017, 18:59 - Tim: Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
18/10/2017, 19:41 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: To do them little ones
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
18/10/2017, 19:45 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
18/10/2017, 20:09 - Chris: Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
18/10/2017, 20:10 - Chris: @447875716351 could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Nah
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Still would stay on a bike most likely
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: If it rains can't skate
18/10/2017, 20:17 - Chris: If only segways weren't banned
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Slippery when wet
18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
18/10/2017, 20:18 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Unless those big ones
18/10/2017, 20:18 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: ðŸ˜‚

18/10/2017, 20:20 - Chris: Might ask to go on walker circuit with the omnium
18/10/2017, 20:22 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: @447875716351 do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
18/10/2017, 20:23 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Stops at all major clients
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: So basically a dedicated van
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Or a single bullit
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: ðŸ˜‚

18/10/2017, 18:58 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Probably cos heâ€™s on a garra ha
18/10/2017, 18:58 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: And thatâ€™s the point of walkers, smash all the shit thatâ€™s so close together it does t make sense to do on a bike
18/10/2017, 18:59 - Tim: Yeh in midtown NYC or something but London how many Herbert's goes ashurst are there
18/10/2017, 19:41 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I don't know about not making much sense when you get easy cash
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: I'm sure it's not faster than a pushbike
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: To do them little ones
18/10/2017, 19:42 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Specialy in London where most of stuff mailroom or loading bay
18/10/2017, 19:45 - â€ª+1 (647) 767-5946â€¬: Yeah this is probably why London doesnâ€™t do walkers, thereâ€™s no core. Well the island is technically, going on itâ€™s age and the type of buildings.
18/10/2017, 20:09 - Chris: Why can't bill just ride a bike tho
18/10/2017, 20:10 - Chris: @447875716351 could be the fastest on the walker circuit if he just pedalled
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: He's on gara so I doesn't matter if he fast or no it's just about getting tired when doing actual walking
18/10/2017, 20:15 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Scooter or a skateboard would be  my choice
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Nah
18/10/2017, 20:16 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Still would stay on a bike most likely
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: If it rains can't skate
18/10/2017, 20:17 - Chris: If only segways weren't banned
18/10/2017, 20:17 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Slippery when wet
18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: How is it that sprint makes a walker circuit
18/10/2017, 20:18 - Chris: But doesn't make a cargo bike circuit
18/10/2017, 20:18 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Unless those big ones

18/10/2017, 20:22 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: @447875716351 do you have to carry quite a lot or one ups mostly
18/10/2017, 20:23 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: And is it envelopes mostly or lever arches and etc what's on pushie channel
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Maybe setting up a minibus service for all the walkers would be a good racket
18/10/2017, 20:24 - Chris: Stops at all major clients
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: So basically a dedicated van
18/10/2017, 20:24 - â€ª+44 7812 074534â€¬: Or a single bullit

27/10/2017, 15:12 - Tim: Demoacracy has to be practiced
27/10/2017, 15:12 - Tim: Can't just be the fake idea that it is
27/10/2017, 15:13 - Tom: You don't need to know that much about it. A load of entitled twats with what they consider to be defined cultural history, want to separate themselves from the rest of the country so they can more directly govern their policies and finances. I'm sure they actually just want to kick out a load of foreigners and stop the 'plague' of tourism. Spain is not exactly the most forward thinking nation in Western Europe and it is also one that struggles with it's history
27/10/2017, 15:14 - Zima Billy: Word
27/10/2017, 15:14 - Tom: Also, this is like Cornwall just deciding for itself that it wants to be independent without checking with Theresa May
27/10/2017, 15:15 - Zima Billy: 3 lions on me shirt
27/10/2017, 15:15 - Tom: Unfortunately because there's like fuck all else in Spain, Madrid worries about losing Barcelona and the revenue it provides from tourism etc
27/10/2017, 15:16 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: well yeah. i'm not as eloquent as tom, but basically people thinking their country or are defines them are pleb tier thinkers. fuck your shit bit of land. grow up and join the rest of the world.

27/10/2017, 15:18 - Zima Billy: Trans nationality
27/10/2017, 15:18 - Tim: Like a working class revolt
27/10/2017, 15:18 - Tim: But what's bad is the way Madrid have handled it
27/10/2017, 15:19 - Tim: But even locals pro leaving don't want it to be handled like the way the Catalan government are doing so either
27/10/2017, 15:19 - Tim: That was some bar talk last. Johny

27/10/2017, 15:27 - Zima Billy: Could it be love?
27/10/2017, 15:28 - Tom: Yeah no worries. I mean I'm all for places being able to decide things for themselves, if they think it has an effect on their cultural identity or whatever. Champagne only made in champagne (don't tell them it's just cheap fizzy wine). If it's a thinly veiled way of being exclusionary or xenophobic then just go fuck yourselves. Could've sworn Spain was a Muslim state for years anyway, just like we're all Norman Vikings. Join the identity fluid revolution !
27/10/2017, 15:29 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: it was a muslim state yeah

03/11/2017, 09:52 - â€ª+44 7983 090770â€¬: But he didn't because he killed his wife then drove 20mph down the motorway
03/11/2017, 09:52 - Tim: But crashing and being so waved you contemplated just staying there as it's closer to work
03/11/2017, 09:53 - â€ª+44 7983 090770â€¬: With loads of Feds telling him not to kill himself so you know

03/11/2017, 09:54 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: but yeah, oj was basically just an actor at that point
03/11/2017, 09:54 - â€ª+44 7983 090770â€¬: That's why Tom = GOAT
03/11/2017, 09:54 - Tim: You seen that Netflix oj thing?

03/11/2017, 09:56 - â€ª+44 7983 090770â€¬: You can't say that he would t have made a comeback because he was in prison
03/11/2017, 09:56 - â€ª+44 7983 090770â€¬: (Don't make comebacks EVER)
03/11/2017, 09:56 - â€ª+44 7983 090770â€¬: An example.
03/11/2017, 09:56 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: ðŸ˜‚
03/11/2017, 09:56 - â€ª+44 7983 090770â€¬: Peyton Manning did nothing, for nobody, never. Tom Brady is the GOAT.
03/11/2017, 09:57 - â€ª+44 7983 090770â€¬: Fair play though
03/11/2017, 09:57 - â€ª+44 7983 090770â€¬: But he's still the ONLY player ever to rush for over 2000 yards in the regular season
03/11/2017, 09:58 - â€ª+44 7983 090770â€¬: Anyway, he's out f prison now so probably gonna remarry and remurder (or kidnap)

03/11/2017, 09:59 - â€ª+44 7983 090770â€¬: Regular season
03/11/2017, 09:59 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: he played his last game like 10 years before (not) murdering his wife
03/11/2017, 09:59 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: and then went to prison like 10 years after that
03/11/2017, 09:59 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: he had plenty of time to make a comeback
03/11/2017, 10:00 - â€ª+44 7454 065666â€¬: the oj trial was quality tv though. only bettered by 11/9

03/11/2017, 10:01 - â€ª+44 7983 090770â€¬: It's peak though
03/11/2017, 10:01 - â€ª+44 7983 090770â€¬: If he never got dropped(or quit to take up murder) he would've actually been on  one of the best teams
03/11/2017, 10:01 - â€ª+44 7983 090770â€¬: Ever
03/11/2017, 10:01 - â€ª+44 7983 090770â€¬: Under the best coach, ever
